      "Document: The Melbourne Declaration recognises the place of ICT in education by it being both a general capability (GC) and a learning area conceptually placed under the umbrella of Technologies. This dual recognition acknowledges the shift to a knowledge-based society and the need for all students to acquire and apply a depth and breadth of ICT knowledge, skills, attitudes, values and ethics in order for them to be successful learners, workers and active citizens. Currently there is no published curriculum documentation for ICT competence as a GC. Rather its place in the Australian Curriculum is recognised within each of the four published learning areas, English, Mathematics, Science and History through embedding in content descriptors and/or achievement standards and through an introductory paragraph explaining the role of ICT in that learning area. This paper discusses four key concerns about the current ICT situation and proposes and justifies a solution whereby ICT would be a learning area in its own right, either within the framework of the Technologies or as a new learning area.

Mobile learning, in general, and distant learning, in particular, in educational contexts has been approached by educationalist all over the world (Hwang &amp; Chang, 2011). Presently, countries pay ample attention to mobile learning in education. Despite the fact that devices such as cell phones might divert students' attention, yet, no one can deny their importance as high-tech educational tools. This study investigates EFL college students' attitudes towards cell phones learning. For the sake of satisfying the study's objectives, a questionnaire has been designed and randomly distributed to 300 female undergraduate students enrolled during the First Academic Term (2014/2015). The questionnaire is consisted of 3 sections and 39 items. Section 1, students' attitudes towards the usefulness of mobile learning (26 items), section 2, investigation of students' opinions towards reasons where and why they and their instructors use cell phones (12 items), and section 3, an open-ended question, asking students if they have any comments on the importance of cell phones (1 item). The questionnaire consisted 5-Point Likert type scale. Data were quantitatively analysed using SPSS, and ANOVA tests.

      "Document: Although bilingual education has been offered in some schools of Sri Lanka since 2001, primary and secondary school education has been conducted mainly in the first language (L1), that is, Sinhala/Tamil. As a result, most students sit for the General Certificate of Education -- Advanced Level (GCE (A/L) examination, which determines university entry, in their L1. Thus, the majority of students entering state universities do so after receiving their entire education in their L1. At the tertiary level, where many (if not most) degree programs are conducted in the English medium, students struggle to make the transition from Sinhala/Tamil medium instruction to English medium instruction (EMI).1This study examines the challenges faced by students and lecturers in three selected state universities due to this language transition. It employs a qualitative research design. Data were collected through official documents and semi-structured interviews with forty academics. Three focus group interviews were conducted with thirty undergraduates. In addition, eighteen non-participant lectures were observed in mainstream2 classrooms. The findings indicate several structural, institutional, and linguistic challenges on the way to a successful implementation of EMI in state universities and demonstrate that the transition from GCE (A/L) to EMI in universities is a challenging experience for both students and lecturers. We propose that the concept of academic literacies be used as a productive means of supporting undergraduates through their transition to EMI.\n",

Specifically, this review focuses on the affordances of digital tools to foster uses of digital literacies of informational/accessibility, collaboration knowledge construction, multimodal communication, gaming literacy, and reflection on learning. Researchers have found relatively high levels of students' engagement through their uses of digital tools for the social purposes of accessing, sharing, communicating, and reflecting on knowledge as part of a shared learning commons. Students are also engaged in multimodal representations of knowledge for immediate and worldwide audiences, as well as participation in collaborative gaming activities for both acquiring knowledge and learning collaboration practices. Researchers have also found that teachers and students employ uses of digital feedback tools and e-portfolios for effectively fostering student reflection. The findings from the research reviewed suggest the need for teachers to identify the affordances of digital tools in ways that remediate and transform largely print-based learning in English language arts classrooms through uses of digital tools.\n",

While nothing has yet been resolved, it still bears some study since developmental education is an important function for most community colleges.    This study adds to the current data of the success of students who take developmental courses. Most of the studies done on the topic of developmental education focus on the comparison between students who had remediation with those who did not. There is not much data that compares the type of instruction given in remedial courses and how the different types of instruction affect student learning outcomes. This study compared two different methods of instructional delivery in a developmental English classroom, straight lecture based classrooms and classes where some type of technology was used to deliver course material, and evaluated the learning outcomes for each class.

Surveys administered to LCTL teachers working in higher education addressed a range of issues relating to the following: the teaching context; the teacher's professional background and qualifications; the teacher's current job situation; and perceived professional development needs. Overall, enrollment levels in LCTL classes varied considerably. Class sizes tended to be small. The highest reported enrollment in advanced classes was in Italian. Many students were heritage speakers of the languages. Often, students had specific research interests in their language. A growing trend in some LCTLs with large heritage groups was to offer courses  tailored to that group, segregating rank beginners from those with at least some exposure. A common complaint among teachers was that LCTL materials were outdated. However, for many languages, new materials had been published in the 1990s. Most teachers worked full time, held tenured or tenure-track positions, and had a Ph.D. degree. Relatively few had extensive preparation specifically in pedagogy. Five professional development needs noted were advocacy for teachers, information about professional issues, opportunities for collaboration, information about technology use, and e-mail list-servs. (Contains 10 references.)

The goal of cultural learning is a continuing search for understanding that bridges cultures. Language can be a bridge, a system that constructs reality as it communicates about reality. Education in the U.S. has tended to define culture as American culture, and so has institutionalized ethnocentrism. To change this approach, significant reforms in teaching are needed: (1) language teachers should no longer call their subject foreign, because this practice engenders prejudice; (2) teachers need more substantial training in semantics, kinesics, proxemics, sociology, anthropology, ethnography, and communications theory; (3) literature should be learned as culture rather than as  criticism; (4) meaning must be combined with grammar, and function with form; (5) language teaching must take into account that the American university model of knowledge and authority may not correspond to that of other countries; and (6) methods and materials should be more geared to what is current and real in other countries.

This was explored through two semi-structured interviews with the teacher, which was transcribed and analyzed using the principles of grounded theory in order to obtain a bottom-up, empirically grounded understanding of the relationship. This approach identified a strong contextual influence in the form of Korea's national university entrance examination, which is a constraint on both the teacher and students, resulting in a high focus on receptive skills, and thus shaping both agents' own respective choices in English language teaching and learning with the end-goal of students' success on the exam.

A lecture was conducted online for one semester (four months) by using Islamic topics as learning materials. The learning materials were presented and discussed, then students were asked to write or talk about the topics. This study uses a descriptive qualitative approach to data collection through the provision of questionnaires and interviews with 47 students of the Islamic Broadcasting Program at the Faculty of Islamic Religion at a private Islamic university in Bogor, Indonesia, in the English language course. From the data collected through a set of questionnaires and interviews it can be concluded that, 1) the majority of respondents are interested in using Islamic materials to learn English; 2) the majority of respondents state that Islamic materials assisted them in improving their English language skills; 3) The majority of respondents are interested in using online Islamic resources using multimodal approach. Furthermore, the respondents stated that the multimodal approach to learning is very interesting, effective, and can help them to learn English. In addition, students wished that direct interaction between lecturers and students could continue to function well. Hence, the use of multimodal-based Islamic materials could provide interactive opportunities between lecturers and students.\n",

Two federally funded consortia--the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium and the Partnership for Readiness of College and Careers--prove focal to this paper, as these two organisations are creating new tests that will assess 42-49% of the K-12 student population in the United States in 2014-2015. Because greater teacher accountability for student performance will be given for these tests, there is more reason to pay attention to what these tests measure and what they do not. Our analysis suggests that these new tests will hold secondary English teachers accountable for literacy and disciplinary knowledge outside the field of English and thus raise important questions about what English teachers should, can and will do, especially when their jobs are on the line.\n",

      "Document: This dissertation explored how a teacher learned to teach with and about unfamiliar (to her) media texts in her high school English classroom. This study also examined my role as the researcher/mentor in the teacher's learning and development process. Through situated learning theories (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991) and discourse through identities (Gee, 2001; 2014a) theoretical frameworks, this study explored the ways the teacher accepted, resisted, and enacted her figured worlds and identities as an English teacher. Historically, texts in the English classroom consist of novels, poems, plays, and the occasional nonfiction book or essay, and English teacher education and development often keeps these texts at the center of English teachers' content knowledge. However, research exploring students' use of multiliteracies in out-of-classroom contexts advocates for a multiliteracies perspective within classrooms. Still, there is a lack of professional development opportunities for teachers to support multiliteracies practices in their classrooms. Further, teachers' professional development is often provided in stand-alone experiences where teachers learn outside of their classroom teaching contexts. Taking place over a six-month time frame, this study is situated as one-on-one professional development mentoring and included researcher and teacher collaboration in multiple contexts including planning, teaching, and reflection. This qualitative case study (Merriam, 1998) sought to address a gap in the literature in how the collaboration of teachers and researchers impacted teacher learning. Using interpretive analysis (Erickson, 1986) and discourse analysis (Gee, 2014a; 2014b) I developed two assertions: (1) The process the teacher underwent from finding resources to teaching and reflection was complex and filled with many phases and challenges, and (2) I, as the researcher/mentor, served as a sounding board and resource for the teacher/learner throughout her process of learning about, teaching with, and reflecting on unfamiliar texts. Findings of this study indicate the teacher's identities and figured worlds impacted both how she learned about and taught with unfamiliar texts, and how I approached my role as a researcher/mentor in the study. Further, findings also indicate collaborative, practice-based research models (Hinchman &amp; Appleman, 2017) offer opportunities to provide teachers meaningful and impactful professional development experiences situated in classroom contexts.

These high school students were engaged in the study of local fresh water ecology with their teacher, the researcher. Transcribed audiotapes of students' discourse, their illustrated guides to macroinvertebrates, their macroinvertebrate indices for two fresh water locations, their power point presentations of findings, and transcribed interviews with three focus students were utilized as data. Findings indicated that, for the most part, students were provided opportunities to enact scientific practices and communications and that they did indeed do so. More specifically, students learned to identify questions and concepts that guide ecology research, formulate and revise scientific explanations using logic and evidence, and communicate scientific arguments. However, students were not provided adequate opportunities to practice defending the scientific arguments they constructed and communicated. They also struggled at times to use scientific language. I close with recommendations for teaching and for conducting qualitative research with English Language Learners in science. Qualitative research holds the potential for revealing what science learning opportunities promote scientific literacy development amongst socioeconomically disadvantaged students.

      "Document: It is generally accepted that second language (L2) acquisition becomes more difficult as one grows older and that success in adult L2 acquisition is highly variable. Nevertheless, humans in language contact situations have to cope with intergroup communication. This article examines the ways society has responded to this challenge. It describes eleven strategies or workarounds that humans use to deal with this problem: developing lingua francas, forming Sprachbunds, practicing exogenous marriage, undergoing language shift, learning the target language imperfectly, developing a pidgin or creole, shifting the learning burden to children, relying on individual differences in aptitude among learners, developing the art and practice of translation, developing machine translation technology, and providing instruction. The eleven strategies can be understood as involving four broad societal responses to the burden of SLA: to simplify the learning task, to create a simpler language, to leave it to a special set of learners, and to provide special training. Finally, the article offers some speculations about the evolutionary reasons for the difficulties experienced in adult L2 acquisition. (Contains 2 notes.)\n",

      "Document: English language teaching (ELT) publishing as we know it today has a long and lucrative history, dating, according to Rix (2008), from the Longman publication of Michael West's &quot;New Method Readers&quot; in 1926, to the present day, where annual turnover runs to around US$194 billion (Jordan &amp; Gray, 2019). Some of the sector's best-sellers, such as Oxford University Press's &quot;Headway&quot; series (Soars &amp; Soars), have sold over 70 million copies (Ozóg, 2018) with OUP's &quot;English File&quot; (Latham-Koenig, Oxenden, &amp; Lambert) selling over a million copies in China alone. Generally speaking, it is taken for granted that commercial publications in the educational sector are based on sound, accepted pedagogical principles. Early language teaching publications (from the 1950s onwards) naturally reflected practices that were thought to promote language learning at that time--such as repetition, drills and sentence-level grammar exercises. As our understanding of language learning developed, this Structural approach gave way to a Communicative one, reflecting the 1970s preoccupation with the importance of communicative competence, influenced by theorists such as Hymes (e.g. 1972) and Halliday (e.g. 1975). This approach remains the predominant one (in the West at least) 50 years later. It represents, remarkably perhaps, the last time that applied linguistics substantially influenced a language teaching approach, or at least, one that had such global reach and enduring influence. Since then, findings from the fields of applied linguistics and second language (L2) acquisition, which should have fed into language learning approaches and hence language coursebooks, have been slow to do so in any systematic or significant way. Where they have, the way in which language learning theory 'translates' into pedagogy in the coursebook and thence classroom, can be questionable. In parallel with this is the problem of the socio-cultural standpoint of teaching materials of an international language such as English, issuing from a particular geographic heartland, viz. England. As with applied linguistics and L2 acquisition research, developments in sociolinguistic, socio-cultural and socio-political theory have been realised in language teaching coursebooks only as a rather superficial multi-cultural gloss. The advent of 'global' coursebooks conceived in the 1990s, with multiple iterations, attempting to capture international appeal, still has not resolved the conundrum that language--and hence language teaching materials, that is, the combination of content and pedagogy--constitute cultural artefacts, imbued with cultural values and ideologies. All in all, as Timmis, Mukundan, and Alkhaldi laconically observe: 'for such commonplace objects, [coursebooks] have aroused a surprising degree of controversy' (2009, p. 11). These then, are the chief areas of contention that I will develop in this article. Opposing these issues, it will be acknowledged that coursebooks remain the default language learning resource, and that teachers and learners world-wide need, want and value them as ready-made language teaching materials.\n",

The current study was set out to explore the effect of using CAAM on Thai EFL learners' argumentative writing performance and their self-regulation of learning awareness. A total of 28 freshman students were purposively selected as the subjects of the study. The researcher used a mixed-mode method type of research involving a pre- and post-test design. Data was collected from a single group of participants who participated in eight sessions based on the use of CAAM in their writing processes. A Self-Regulation of Learning Scale (SRS) was utilized to identify the students' awareness of their self-regulation of learning. The results reveal that the CAAM method used by the respondents made noteworthy gains on their argumentative writing performance across task achievement, coherence-cohesion, lexical resource and grammatical range and accuracy, as indicated by a significant difference between their pre- and post- test results. Furthermore, four out of six components of SRS reveal a significant relationship with their writing performance indicative that the respondents have become more cognizant of their self-regulation in terms of planning, self-monitoring, effort and self-efficacy. Finally, qualitative findings reveal that the respondents had positive feelings about using CAAM in their writing processes as well as enhanced their awareness on their self-regulation of learning.\n",

The mechanics of English composition are categorized into specific areas of competence; these categories form the basis for three tracks, taught simultaneously throughout the quarter. Students are assigned to that track in which their writing reveals them to be most deficient; at the end of each ten-week cycle, students are retested and may be reassigned to the same track or assigned to a different one. In evaluative questionnaires completed by students, 78% of students have indicated preference for the track method over the regular lecture method. In an effort to evaluate the approach analytically, a study was made to determine whether  students taught by this method in the first quarter of freshman English would earn higher grades in the second quarter than would students taught by the traditional method. Analysis of the results indicated that students taught by the track approach tended to be better prepared for the second quarter course and that the track method is equally effective with students of verbal ability above or below the median of their peers.

An evaluation was conducted to determine how well it had met its aim of preparing students of limited English proficiency (LEP) for career opportunities through vocational, technical, and academic education. Instruction in English as a second language (E.S.L.) and native language arts, in addition to bilingual instruction in mathematics, science, and social studies, was provided to approximately 60 Spanish-speaking students of LEP. Also program students were assigned to an all-English exploratory vocational course to expose them to a variety of occupations. In 1983-84, curriculum development was delayed by the late arrival of Title VII funds,  but program staff conducted extensive research on materials related to job survival skills, translated materials from English textbooks, and designed five student workshops on career awareness. Staff development activities included a pre-service orientation, monthly meetings, attendance at demonstration lessons, outside workshops professional conferences, and university courses. Efforts to involve parents in school activities were generally unsuccessful, so the program's parental involvement component was established as a priority for its second year. To improve the program's overall effectiveness, it is recommended that: (1) student achievement data be collected; (2) teacher-training activities be conducted on the role of the paraprofessional in the vocational classroom, teaching Spanish  as a native language, and developing teacher-made materials; (3) more space be allocated to separate tutoring and couseling from administration activities; (4) teachers not acquainted with bilingual education be better informed; and (5) efforts be made to improve parent involvement.

It also allows for more personal contact with students and permits a teacher to indicate more adequately how errors can be corrected. One helpful technique is for the teacher to leave the tape recorder on while trying to provide a correction to an awkward sentence, thereby allowing the student to hear the teacher trying various ways of correction before deciding on the most satisfactory one. This gives students a chance to hear how writing is generated and to gain some courage from hearing the teacher's struggle to write. Although it takes time to get used to using a tape cassette, the advantages make it worthwhile. (TJ)\n",

Participants were 122 students who completed the course in 2013 and 2014. In both classes, students were organized into groups of three to six to write collaborative blog-based role-play fanfiction of a missing moment from JRR Tolkien's fantasy novel &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; The 31 resulting pieces of collaborative fanfiction, the online formats they were published in, the 122 reflective essays produced by the two classes, and interviews with a focal group of participants were used to explore how technology and learners' experience with this technology may have mediated the resulting stories. In addition, the classroom fanfiction texts were compared with comparable online writing published in the fanfiction site Archive of Our Own (Ao3) to identify thematic and stylistic differences. The results showed that students' lack of familiarity with publishing in blogs often posed a challenge that some groups were able to overcome or exploit to facilitate or enhance the readability of their completed stories. Compared to online fanfiction, the classroom fanfiction was less innovative with respect to focal characters yet more collective in its focus, with stories being told from multiple characters' perspectives.\n",

California State Budget Act language for fiscal year 2008-09 (Item 6110-156-0890 provision 3) requires the California Department of Education (CDE) to report on the implementation of the WIA Title II. Fiscal year 2008-09 represents the tenth year of WIA Title II implementation. Two major implementation goals are to: (1) increase performance outcomes; (2) increase student success in transitions to postsecondary education and to the workforce. WIA Title II multiyear grants are funded on a pay-for-performance basis. California's federal funding allocation plan is based on documented student performance and goal attainment in educational programs. Each year, California uses the student performance data to negotiate performance goals with the United States Department of Education (ED), Office of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE), for eleven literacy levels within the program areas of ABE, ASE, and ESL, and the four core follow-up outcome measures of: (1) entered employment; (2) retained employment; (3) entered postsecondary education or training; and (4) attained a GED certificate or high school diploma. The literacy level performance goals are based on the percentage of all enrollees who complete a literacy level within the program year. The core follow-up outcome measures are based on the percentage of adult learners who identify specific goals for their enrollment and achieve their goals after exiting the program. Appended are: (1) Progress Measures; (2) WIA Title II Enrollments and Performance; (3) CASAS Skill Level Descriptors for ABE and ASE; and (4) CASAS Skill Level Descriptors for ESL.

This research used a mixed method in which both quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed. The research samples were 39 high school English teachers in the Siak region. The research instrument used is a questionnaire comprising 38 closed and three open questions, distributed online via Google Forms. The questionnaire was designed using Likert Scale with options ranging from 1-5 (very poor to very good) Data were also collected using semi-structured interviews to enrich data from the Google Form. This study found that the total average score of quantitative data is 4.1, classified as good. That means the implementation of authentic assessment by English teachers is at a good level. Then from the qualitative data analysis, it appeared that most teachers have a positive perception of authentic assessment as a tool for monitoring and evaluating student learning outcomes. However, there are still some problems faced by the teachers in implementing this assessment, such as the lack of time allotment for the English subject at school and the complexity of the assessment procedures. This implies that some policies are required to make the authentic assessment work well at school levels so teachers can benefit from the assessment for improving English learning at schools.\n",

Inclusion is especially important when we consider the possibilities for transnational civic culture and education. The theoretical framework of this study is based upon concepts of positionality, identity, and belonging as they are related to student understanding of communities. A dual-language, third-grade classroom provided the site for this ethnographic study. Data included participant observations, interviews with the teacher and students, and artifacts of student work. Findings illustrate how the students in the study understood the complexity of their identities at a young age and how the teacher used culturally sustaining pedagogy to foster a third space where this understanding was encouraged.\n",

      "Document: Translanguaging, the movement between communicative modes and features of different languages, is becoming an established research tradition in content-focused second language learning contexts. Pedagogic translanguaging practices nevertheless remain under-applied and under-researched in foreign language instructional settings, whether face-to-face or online. Synchronous virtual foreign language classrooms represent particularly rich spaces in which to begin to explore such practices, due to their multimodal affordances on the one hand and their technical constraints on the other. This study examines the pedagogic translanguaging practices that occur in a corpus of beginner-level Spanish online group tutorial data. A macro-level analysis of the interactional patterns that occur within this context reveals that both teacher participants follow closely the pedagogic prescriptions provided by the course designers with regard to the activities they employ. The finding that these activities offer limited opportunities for students to move between communicative modes and languages may be attributed in part to the emphasis on spoken interaction in this particular setting. A complementary micro-level analysis nevertheless reveals a more autonomous and intuitive approach to the teachers' choice of language when mediating such activities. Instances of student code-switching are relatively few, however. The study concludes with a call to course designers and practitioners to experiment with integrating a wide range of pedagogic translanguaging opportunities into online foreign language classroom activities, with a view to enhancing teaching, learning and communication in such environments.\n",

To obtain the data, the researcher carried out interviews with 70 students of English Education Department (EED) of &quot;Universitas Muria Kudus&quot; (UMK) who took Academic Writing I and II courses. A qualitative analysis was then administered by identifying and classifying contents of students' opinions and reflections expressed in the students' responses concerning the backwash effects of the portfolio assessment applied in the courses. This investigation concludes the followings. First, all the research subjects support the use of portfolio assessment in Academic Writing Classes. Second, portfolio assessment provides various positive backwash effects on the student learning. Third, the students consider the portfolio assessment a fairer assessment. These findings suggest that the students respond positively to the portfolio assessment. Thus, it is recommended that the application of portfolio assessment in academic writing classes be maintained.

We all want to live in a better world where all diversities are cherished, so teaching should be a medium to activate and tolerate different ways of thinking in a respectful manner. In such an activity, teachers can ask questions that require critical thinking skills and creative skills. In this practice-based case study, the researcher, who was also the instructor of two A1 level one-year English preparatory classes at university with a total number of 50 students, started each lesson with five pieces of art and it was observed that even the quietest students expressed their views in English about the paintings.

The current study sought to explore whether nativeness/non-nativeness affects the criteria teachers consider for teacher quality evaluation. To this end, the participants were provided with five video clips of teaching, each presenting a 10-min lesson taught in a real classroom environment. They were requested to rate the quality of the teachers and to point out and describe the criteria they used to rate the teachers. Content analysis of the data indicated that preparation, caring, classroom management, and instruction constituted the general criteria the native and non-native teachers employed to evaluate teacher quality. Considerable differences, however, were observed between the two groups regarding a few of the criteria. The native teachers valued teachers' efficient use of learners' L1 more than the non-native teachers, while teachers' linguistic accuracy and fluency of speech were highlighted by more non-native teachers. Besides, issues related to caring, management, and instruction grabbed the attention of both native and non-native teachers, while preparation received substantially less attention. It can be concluded that the use of video-mediated peer observation can provide a platform to uncover the implicit beliefs teachers hold toward teacher quality.\n",

Yet such knowledge is invaluable for many reasons. Graduate students can become more accurate critics of their own writing, if they can make use of some of the tools of linguistic or rhetorical analysis. They can become more skillful literary critics and better teachers of both literature and writing. Furthermore, fully one-half of the teaching jobs currently available at the college level include the teaching of composition; therefore, at least one-half of the English doctoral students who plan to teach in four-year colleges and universities ought to have some  formal instruction in composition. The paper lists the aims of a graduate concentration in composition, both for M.A. and Ph.D. candidates, and makes a few general suggestions for curriculum requirements for a minor or major in composition.

This difference is usually attributed to cognitive maturation, but adults also receive more explicit instruction than children, which may influence their learning strategies. This study crosses instruction condition with age, teaching forty children aged 5;3 to 7;11 and forty adults an artificial mini-language under implicit or explicit training conditions. Participants produced novel sentences and judged sentence grammaticality equally well in either condition, but both children and adults in the explicit training condition developed greater awareness of the mini-language's structures--and greater awareness was associated with better performance for both age groups. Results show that explicit instruction affects children and adults in the same way, supporting the hypothesis that age differences in implicit vs. explicit L2 learning are not exclusively caused by maturation, but also influenced by instruction.\n",

Therefore, the effective use of LLSs is determined by various factors, including both learning and learner variables. This dynamic and complex nature of LLSs renders it appropriate to use a qualitative approach to undertake research into this issue. This paper details the qualitative findings from a larger-scale study on English LLSs among tertiary students in the context of Vietnam. The data was gathered from semi-structured interviews with 10 English as a foreign language (EFL) teaching staff and 10 EFL students at a university in Vietnam. Interviews were conducted in Vietnamese lasting 30 to 40 minutes, and were audio recorded with consent. The interview questions for students focussed on their general attitudes and lived experiences of LLSs. Similarly, the interview questions for EFL staff were structured around their general attitudes. The interview data were translated into English, rechecked, and thematically analysed. The findings are of a textual and interpretative nature with emerging themes and issues related to the attitudes towards and actual use of LLSs among the target learners. The findings provide practical implications for practitioners, researchers and educational policy makers alike.\n",

      "Document: This article is about current policy in the coordination of opportunities for adult migrants in England to learn English. People who move to a different country experience a need to learn the dominant language of their new environment, to support their settlement. A willingness to learn the language is a marker of social inclusion from a political perspective too: an insistence that migrants have an obligation to learn and use the language is a recurrent trope in political and media discourse. In the UK, language education for adult migrants focuses on the area of education known as ESOL, English for Speakers of Other Languages. Beyond the rhetoric, policy support for migrants' learning of English across the UK is inconsistent: there is neither a UK-wide nor an England-specific strategy in policy to support access to ESOL. Where policy exists, it is formed at a local level in the absence of national direction. The aim of this paper is to consider how an important area of adult education appears to have little presence in national policy, and what the implications of this are, for practice. To achieve this, we first follow the trajectory of ESOL policy in England, considering why--despite attempts to address its coordination--there remains a lacuna. Second, we ask what the implications are of this policy gap for ESOL coordination in practice. Analysis of current policy and of interviews with key ESOL stakeholders suggests an enduring condition of fragmentation and lack of coordination to the detriment of students.\n",

Two classes involving intercultural communication activities were then given to two groups of Japanese students who were studying English in a Japanese university.

In doing so, ELT practices may be better able to adapt themselves to the intercultural communicative needs of local contexts. This paper argues that an essential element in fostering successful intercultural communication is developing cultural awareness as part of ELT pedagogy. To illustrate this, a case study of Thailand is presented examining English use, English teaching policy and practice, and local cultural attitudes towards ELT. This then leads to suggestions on how locally relevant intercultural communicative practices can form part of ELT classroom pedagogy in Thailand with the aim of developing learners' cultural awareness. It is argued that similar analyses may be applied to other Asian contexts, which may share features with the Thai context. This can lead to the development of teaching practices, which through engaging learners in intercultural reflection will result in English language users who are better able to manage intercultural communication through English.

The results indicated that participants used diverse sources of intertextual links, and with such links they were able to inquire more about what they were reading within a broader framework that went beyond merely discussing the story itself. Three patterns of interactive talk were identified, namely collaborative, complementary and conflicting, which functioned to share, negotiate and conflict meaning, respectively, and an investigation of these showed that intertextuality not only allowed students to become more involved in idiosyncratic responses, but also offered more opportunities for students to judge and reshape their responses by genuinely considering others' opinions and idea.

The major  conclusions reached in this study are: (1) a strong commitment to a maintenance philosophy of bilingual education approached in a team-teaching manner has created the environment for the Spanish language that allows coordinate bilingualism to develop; (2) the two separate language environments and models have encouraged students to use the languages independently of each other, thus producing a higher degree of bilingualism; (3) strong native language development has been shown to be the key to second language acquisition; and (4) Anglo students have become progressively more bilingual.

It extracts 19 common components, denoted as alphabets, from Chinese characters. Nineteen postures were designed according to the shapes of these alphabets. Instead of memorizing Chinese characters through repetitive copying, students can first associate an alphabet with the corresponding designed posture. Then, they break down a Chinese character into a set of alphabets in order to perform the sequence of corresponding postures so that they can easily remember the whole character. Our proposed system contains two major functions: 1) the learning function that is responsible for delivering the courseware, and 2) the testing function that is used to let students acquire their learning progress through some tests. A rule-based algorithm is designed to recognize the students' input postures captured from the Kinect motion sensor so as to determine whether the students have performed the correct postures. We conducted a survey which involved 90 students to try our proposed system as well as two other learning modes for comparison. Moreover, we have interviewed those 30 students who had tried our proposed system with some open-ended questions. The positive results show that the proposed system can promote students' experiences in learning Chinese characters.\n",

      "Document: This study reports on the impact of 11 West European first languages on the acquisition of Dutch. Using data from nearly 6,000 second-language learners, it was found that the mother tongue had a rather large impact on two language skills--namely, oral and written proficiency--as measured by the scores received by these learners on the State Examination of Dutch as a Second Language. Multilevel analyses showed that the effect of the mother tongue can adequately be modeled by means of the cognate linguistic distance measure, adopted from McMahon and McMahon (2005). The explanative power of the genetic linguistic distance measure (Cavalli-Sforza, Menozzi, &amp; Piazza, 1994), on the other hand, was rather poor. Additionally, learner characteristics (age of arrival, length of residence, hours studying Dutch, education, and gender) and context characteristics (quality of schooling in the country of origin and multilingual country of origin) explained part of the variation in Dutch speaking and writing skills.\n",

      "Document: The purpose of this study is to examine whether a difference exists in TOEIC Bridge® Institutional Program scores between Japanese English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students at a technical college who did extensive reading (ER) for one year and those who did ER for two years. Furthermore, by dividing the students who experienced ER for two years into two subgroups according to their level of English achievement at the end of ER, their reading tendencies were statistically analyzed in terms of the number of words and books they had read. The results suggested that two-year-long ER may be more effective in improving TOEIC Bridge reading scores than a year-long ER program, and that students may be able to reach a high level of English proficiency without reading too many books as long as they are suited to the students' English levels. Additionally, students with high English proficiency made greater progress through ER. These results highlighted the significance of incorporating ER into the reading course to develop balanced reading skills; the need for careful consideration in setting goals for ER in the number of books read; and the need for teachers' support and guidance, particularly for beginners.\n",

Using two corpora, (i) a student corpus of about 62,000 words of postgraduate computing project reports, written at the end of the MSc programme and roughly equivalent to the master's dissertation; and (ii) an expert corpus of about 88,000 words of computing articles taken from prestigious journals, a quantitative analysis of the students' and experts' texts reveals that almost 80% of the personal pronouns found in the student corpus are of \"I\", while the figure in the expert corpus is less than 3%. Over 400 occurrences of \"I\" in the student corpus, but only six occurrences of \"I\" in the expert corpus, were classified as methodological. A qualitative analysis of the data in the student corpus reveals how methodological \"I\" can help to achieve a range of textual effects. Methodological \"I\" is used to recount procedure step by step, to the extent that even unsuccessful stages of the research process are included. These failures are attributed to lack of knowledge, skills, or equipment. Working in concert with language which stresses the tight deadlines the students are obliged to meet, methodological \"I\" can promote the researcher by highlighting their resourcefulness in managing to get their project completed on schedule. Methodological \"I\" also helps the student writers to justify their procedure, showing it to be sound and rigorous, thus indirectly promoting the researcher by associating them with methodological diligence. However, even when the students feel obliged to record their procedural failures, methodological \"I\" can help them create a favourable impression on the reader by constructing them as tenacious neophytes whose repertoire of computing skills has increased considerably as a result of working on their research project. The study ends with the pedagogical implications of the findings for EAP teachers and students.\n",

Focus was on building a multi-regional teacher capability in ABE through teacher training models. Phase one involved program planning and pre-conference orientation of participants and resource personnel. A three-week on-campus workshop, phase two, centered on an in-depth study of learning modules selected by the participants. Modules selected pertained to: the nature of the undereducated urban adult learner, communication, fostering positive self-perception of urban ABE students, micro-teaching, methods and diagnosis of ABE teaching, teaching  English as a second language (ESL), and diagnosis of local needs and program development. Phase three, designed to actualize the urban teacher training developed during the previous phase, proved to be the most significant part of the project. Through a task team capability delivery system, programs were launched in: Bridgeport; Raleigh, North Carolina; Amherst, Massachusetts; Glenmont, New York. An important outcome of the project was model dissemination at local, State, regional, and national levels.

The central task, the &quot;Language Use Profile&quot;--part of the foundations course in our language teacher education programs--guided language teachers in developing their understandings of their bi-/multilingual language use, language ideologies, and systemic functional linguistics (SFL). In all three cases, examination of language use served as a window for the language teachers to observe their intersectionality or, in some cases, to become aware of it. Each language teacher took up the assignment in different ways, with the task as the context for reflection on language use and identities journeys such as &quot;translanguaging to survive,&quot; &quot;negotiating my identity&quot; and being a &quot;white woman who learned Spanish.&quot; SFL metalanguage served as a tool for the language teachers to make sense of their multidimensional language use.

In our research we investigated the differences in the motivational and intercultural contact measures as well as determinants of motivated behaviour between learners of English and German. Our results indicate that students of English have a more positive attitude towards the native speakers of the language they study than learners of German, and children who study English have higher levels of linguistic self-confidence, invest more energy into language learning and receive more support from their environment than students of German. Our findings also reveal that learners of English experience more frequent direct written contact and contact through media products than learners of German. For both groups of language learners the results indicate that students with high levels of motivational intensity engage in various types of intercultural contact more frequently than students who invest less energy into language learning. Our findings seem to suggest that it is motivational intensity rather than the language being studied that affects what factors predict how much energy students are willing to invest in language learning.

This paper examines the ways in which changes in South Korea's labor market and corporate recruitment culture have affected the ideologies and practices of the country's youth with regard to the English language. By drawing on Bourdieu's concept of distinction and specifying the processes of distinction into &quot;replacement,&quot; &quot;opposition,&quot; and &quot;addition,&quot; this paper clarifies the ideological construction and effects of oral communicative competence in English through an ethnographic analysis of post-secondary learners studying English in a study abroad context. Influenced by South Korea's recruitment culture, these learners distinguish primarily between learning English for standardized tests in South Korea and learning English for authentic communication while studying abroad. However, the efforts of learners who have studied abroad to develop their oral English skills bear limited fruit in South Korea's recruitment culture, which does not fully appreciate the value of the job seeker's experience of having studied English abroad. Thus, the limits of distinction function to impose the burden of English learning on individual learners.\n",

This study compares an extensive reading class against a more traditional class involving intensive reading and vocabulary exercises. The classes were part of a Saudi college presessional course, and this classroom setting posed several problems for the extensive reading approach, including relatively weak students, an environment where pleasure reading is atypical, and the course being of short duration. The result is that the reported extensive reading class was carried out in what could be considered challenging conditions. Nevertheless, gain scores in reading comprehension ability, reading speed, and vocabulary acquisition showed that the extensive reading approach was just as effective as the intensive approach, even though some of the measurement instruments for these variables should have favored the intensive approach. Moreover, the extensive reading participants reported much more positive attitudes toward reading, their class, and their learning than the participants in the intensive reading group. Overall, these results indicate that, for the variables studied, the extensive reading approach was as good as, or better than, the more focused intensive reading approach.

Proper assessment of English learners is essential for progress monitoring, determining language proficiency, predicting achievement, and identifying students with disabilities. However, because of linguistic and cultural factors, traditional norm-referenced standardized tests of achievement may not be valid for language minority students. In light of these issues, as well as the growing gap in achievement between language minority and language majority students, greater accountability in the education of English learners is needed.

The results suggest that morphological awareness and phonological decoding contributed to reading comprehension in Spanish whereas only morphological awareness contributed to reading comprehension in English. For mediators, listening comprehension played a larger role than word reading in supporting reading comprehension in Spanish and English, but oral vocabulary only contributed in Spanish.

This article further explores the dynamicity of multilingual learners' language systems and the influences that induce change.

      "Document: Teaching English to Young Learners (TEYL) through animated stories bears many prospects for an effective and meaningful language instruction as animated stories can help to contextualize the new language providing audiovisual input along with the story narration. In this study, the role of animated stories in teaching EFL (English as a Foreign Language) to Young Learners (YLs) was investigated. The potential role of using such an approach was assessed in terms of students' attitudes towards learning English. Five authentic animated stories were used as overarching themes into which some basic vocabulary, structures, and functions of the target language were integrated. On the whole, the outcome of the study is that students kept their initial positive attitudes towards learning English with animated stories. The study also proved that students' concerns related to learning English decreased through such instruction. The findings of the present research also suggest that animated stories offer teachers opportunities to present and recycle vocabulary, grammar, and functions of the target language in context through integrating many extension activities related to the story theme.\n",

      "Document: A study to learn if a special course on teaching composition to high school students would affect the classroom competence of prospective English teachers was conducted. An experimental group of 36 future English teachers at DePaul University was compared with a control group of 36 similar students at Loyola University, a school with a parallel English Education program. The independent variable was the special composition course taught at DePaul. The two test instruments developed to measure the effect of the special course were the &quot;Examination in English Composition for Secondary School English Teachers&quot; and the &quot;Scale for Rating Teaching of English Composition.&quot; Although the tests revealed no statistically significant performance differences between the two groups, the  expeimental group, which was below the control group in English grade point total, did as well as its counterpart. The equal test scores apparently resulted from the small sample involved and the complexities of administrative arrangements for the experiment. Since the experimental group improved more than the control group, the inference is that a special course on teaching English composition in the high school classroom would be beneficial for the prospective English teacher.

However, for children considered outside the mainstream, these transitions can provide extra challenge for them, their families and educators. This paper reveals the findings of two qualitative studies investigating early years' transitions. The first study focused on the transition of children with disabilities into early childhood education and care (ECEC) centres; the second explored transition to school for emergent bilingual children. These studies highlight 'strengths-based' perspectives (Perry, Dockett, &amp; Petriwskyj, 2013), wherein participants are understood as experts in their own lives bringing strengths as well as challenges to the new context. Despite the differences in participants, timing and methods, key themes were evident across the studies: parent perceptions of transition; educator attitudes; and home/centre or home/school relationships. These themes are significant to all educational transitions for children considered outside the mainstream.\n",

Research suggests that in their transition to English, non-native speakers fall behind academically, which can intensify the longer a student remains in an English learner program. State education leaders are mindful of this and have implemented policies to identify, serve and reclassify English learners as they become proficient. This resource captures each state's process for the reclassification of English learners as English proficient. States provide for English language proficiency assessment administration, a review of student academic achievement and assessment results, and teacher observations and recommendations, among other methods for reclassification.

Research of the Mexican educational system has suggested that outdated teaching methods contribute to a lack of student motivation, which negatively impact learning. This study sought to identify Mexican English learners' perception of five factors associated with motivation to learn. To that end, a self-report questionnaire was completed by 240 Mexican university students. The factors explored that influence the learning process were empowerment, usefulness, success, interest, and caring in their English classes. The findings revealed that learners experienced relatively higher levels of usefulness, success, and caring in their classes, and lower levels of empowerment and interest. Furthermore, females and low achievers reported significantly lower levels of various components. It was concluded, first, that Mexican EFL students experience different levels of the five factors associated with motivation, a finding that can guide teachers to make improvements in the teaching and learning process. Second, because females and low achievers are at a disadvantage, motivationally speaking, it is essential that English teaching professionals respond to the needs of these two cohorts.\n",

The approach makes use of optical scanning equipment in scoring cloze-elide test exercises, thereby providing a rapid, relatively inexpensive and objective measure of language proficiency. The cloze-elide technique requires the test taker to strike out irrelevant or incorrect words that have been inserted into a prose passage. An assessment of language proficiency at the elementary and secondary levels was carried out in the Elgin (Illinois) School District during the winter and spring of 1985. This evaluation gathered evidence concerning the validity of cloze-elide tests for criteria described in  terms of 10 variables. The validity coefficients displayed in Table I showed that, for the ESL students, the cloze-elide measure: (1) is very strongly correlated with other cloze measures; (2) is well correlated with measures of writing and reading; (3) shows moderate to strong validity for listening and speaking; (4) displays strong correlations with a composite variable of language proficiency; (5) is substantially related to student self-ratings; (6) is substantially related to teacher appraisals of student's language skills; and (7) displays good validity for English language proficiency of native English speakers.

Also investigated are the language ideologies and the linguistic culture animating language management practices through which conservation of the heritage language and culture is pursued. One central finding is that despite strong affiliations to Arabic and active efforts to maintain Arabic skills in younger UK-born individuals of Yemeni heritage there appears to be a shift underway towards English-dominant bilingualism in this younger generation. There remains, however, considerable variability between individuals in language repertoires and Arabic language proficiency, and this significantly qualifies generalisations about language shift. The paper also comments on the secular and religious discourses found in discussions of the reasons for complementary school attendance, and on the efforts made by parents to secure the home as an Arabic-speaking space. The paper concludes with the observation that this study of a Yemeni community helps highlight a diversity within the UK Muslim population that popular discourses tend to overlook.

Students who had completed language courses in LIS programs in both countries were surveyed with regard to their motivation for language study, application of language skills in the workplace, most and least valuable aspects of the courses, and overall usefulness of courses. The results suggest that students in graduate LIS programs are interested in learning foreign languages when the courses are targeted to the students' specific interests and professional needs. The findings provide a curricular enhancement model that could be adopted at other universities, with key considerations focused on customizing language courses to the LIS context, required and elective course offerings, course delivery formats and student motivation.\n",

It examines how portfolio assessment implemented in an English proficiency course promotes learner autonomy among Malaysian tertiary learners. A case study approach has been selected as it provides a suitable context to accomplish the aim of the study. To achieve the objective of the study, Sociocultural theory (SCT) and a reconceptualized construct of learner autonomy are adapted. This paper will discuss the use of portfolio assessment and its development of the psychological dimension of autonomy among English as Second language (ESL) tertiary students of different ethnicity. In this pilot study, data was collected from two students via background questionnaire form, face to face interview, and observation field notes. Participants were selected through purposeful, and homogeneous sampling. It is found that these participants experienced the motivational and affective sub dimensions of the psychological aspect of autonomy while completing their portfolio assessment. Findings from this study highlighted how portfolio assessment enables the participants to practice autonomous learning in its different psychological sub dimensions due to conditions such as self-confidence, portfolio assessment process, portfolio requirements, teacher factor, and the identification of strengths and weaknesses. It is hoped that the findings would benefit the ESL instructors and learners in their attempt to understand and consequently improve the teaching and learning of the writing skills by using portfolio assessment and provides insight into the practice of autonomous learning among learners of different cultural background.\n",

Classification errors occur when students who were predicted to excel subsequently do not excel or when students who were not predicted to excel do. Using a longitudinal sample, we assessed the accuracy of measures of verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, nonverbal reasoning, and current achievement for predicting later achievement. We found that seemingly small differences in predictive validity substantially changed the number of students erroneously included or excluded from the program. Surprisingly, nonverbal tests not only led to more classification errors but also failed to identify more English language learners and minority students. To increase equity and maintain fairness, practitioners should carefully evaluate claims that scores from alternative assessments are as valid as scores from conventional ability tests and verify that the use of these tests result in greater diversity.

Language policies can influence decisions about teaching methodologies either directly, by making explicit recommendations about the methods to be used in classroom practice, or indirectly, through the conceptualisation of language learning which underlies the policy. It can be argued that all language policies have the potential to influence teaching methodologies indirectly and that those policies which have explicit recommendations about methodology are actually functioning of two levels. This allows for the possibility of conflict between the direct and indirect dimensions of the policy which results from an inconsistency between the explicitly recommended methodology and the underlying conceptualisation of language teaching and learning which informs the policy.\n",

Theoretical concepts from translation theory are applied to discuss students' perceptions of cultural diversity. The translation of the term in the student-centred learning activities led to individual and collaborative reflection in which controversial connotations and ethical dilemmas were debated. In the student narratives, conventional connotations were appraised; however, differing aspects were emphasized. When role-playing was used, the students' interpretations were more emotive. The students tended to cast the role of teacher in the majority cultural position, thereby impeding the possibility to view the term in a wider perspective.

The present study aims to examine whether young Chinese-speaking ESL learners have a target-like preference for transferred negation and whether they have a system-wide representation of transferred negation in their early English development. Based on the corpora compiled with longitudinal data of a Chinese-speaking child learning English as a second language, the present study analyzed the child's collocation of matrix verbs with transferred negation and non-transferred negation, the distribution of matrix verbs in transferred negation, and the distribution of negation types in terms of different matrix verbs. The findings show that the verb THINK predominates the matrix verbs of the child's transferred negation. The imbalanced distribution of matrix verbs in his transferred negation is related to the skewed input of verbs. In sentences with the matrix verb THINK, the child has a target-like preference for transferred negation as opposed to non-transferred negation. However, he does not show a target-like preference for transferred negation in sentences with the matrix verb LOOK LIKE. Hence, we argue that young ESL learners' generalizations about constructions are focused around particular verbs that occur frequently in those constructions. Young ESL learners do not have an abstract system-wide representation at the earliest stage of second language acquisition. Instead, their ESL acquisition is based on specific verbs.\n",

Drawing mainly on data from questionnaires, it shows how the early part of their stay was marked by surprise, disappointment and disorientation at the diversity and perceived poor quality of the Englishes they encountered. It is suggested that this &quot;language shock&quot; can be attributed in large part to the students' lack of sociolinguistic awareness, in that they expected London speech to provide a model of &quot;good&quot; English, in line with their perceptions of Beijing Chinese. They also expected to hear only &quot;good&quot; English within a university, and were surprised to hear lecturers with regional accents, associating non-RP accents with non-standard forms of the language. Given that these kinds of experience are unlikely to be restricted solely to Chinese students, or even to those studying in London, it is recommended that some sociolinguistic awareness-raising be built into UK universities' EAP provision. This would enable overseas students to understand better the new linguistic environment in which they find themselves, and thus to become more effective and productive learners, more quickly.\n",

The examples, taken from the Filipino dialect Tagalog, illustrate how ignorance of the cultural assumptions and attitudes associated with an utterance may well lead to misunderstanding and conflict. What is noteworthy about these examples is that, although they are commonplace and conventional, they conceal a dimension of meaning as long as the Tagalog speaker communicates with other Tagalog speakers, either in English or in Tagalog. When the speaker talks with a native speaker of English, however, potential problems not entirely obvious to either the speaker or the hearer may  occur because the speaker uses lexical equivalents in the target language and the hearer adds a cultural dimension of meaning. For these reasons, foreign language instructors should insist on having cultural notes and comments included in second language learning texts and activities. (RL)\n",

Then they were equally distributed in two control and experimental groups and received a validated pretest of reading aloud and speaking in English. Afterward, the treatment was performed in 18 sessions by singing preselected songs culled based on some criteria such as popularity, familiarity, amount, and speed of speech delivery, etc. In the end, the posttests of reading aloud and speaking in English were administered. The results revealed that the treatment had statistically positive effects on the connected speech aspects of English learners' speech production at statistical 0.05 level of significance. Meanwhile, the results represented that there was not any significant difference between the experimental group's mean scores on the posttests of reading aloud and speaking. It was thus concluded that providing the EFL learners with English verbal songs could positively affect connected speech aspects of both modes of speech production, reading aloud and speaking. The Findings of this study have pedagogical implications for language teachers to be more aware and knowledgeable of the benefits of verbal songs to promote speech production of language learners in terms of naturalness and fluency.\n",

The grades of students in both classes improved from pre-test to post-test but in different ways. The students in the target class included more ideas (content) in their essays, whereas the students in the comparison class put more emphasis on the organization of their ideas. We discuss our findings to identify strengths and weaknesses of our approach, and we end the paper by suggesting some directions for further research.\n",

A total of 923 essays from 23 classes of 12 senior high schools in Taiwan (Republic of China) were obtained and scored manually and electronically. The results show that the consistency between human raters is significantly higher than the consistency between human raters and the automated essay scoring system. To discover whether the students were confident with the automated essay grading system, a questionnaire was also distributed. The results indicate the participants realize their vocabulary level was inadequate, and they wanted to know the scores the automated essay grading system gave them along with the generated comments regarding their compositions.

      "Document: This paper proposes &quot;perceptual multilingualism&quot; as a research interest within the broader folk linguistic enterprise. By drawing on the geolinguistic mapping tasks popular in perceptual dialectology -- whereby participants are asked to draw and depict dialectal diversity in a given region -- we show that perceptual multilingualism can elicit knowledge and reasoning in the community about linguistic diversity more broadly. To do this, we analysed and discussed 41 perceptual multilingualism maps produced by high school students in Hong Kong about societal multilingualism across the Hong Kong region. On the one hand, the maps allowed us to quantify which languages manifest in the youths' metalinguistic awareness and where. On the other hand, we positioned the maps as discourses to be compared and analysed through a critical social theoretical lens. Doing so revealed implicit and contested power relations as they manifested in epistemic claims in dialectic relation to broader sociopolitical narratives in Hong Kong. This included Hong Kong's contentious transition to governance by Beijing and the marginalisation of the blue-collar workforce. Beyond the empirical metalinguistic data, our paper shows that perceptual multilingualism can contribute to critical sociolinguistics by helping to reveal power relations, hegemonies and ideologies, and resistance.\n",

Findings revealed that level of instruction significantly moderated the relationship between reading and persuasive writing, but not descriptive writing. Regardless of level of language instruction, reading comprehension was a significant predictor of descriptive writing performance.

      "Document: Background: Studies indicate that difficulties English second language (ESL) learners experience in the classroom may not be attributed to only listening comprehension of the language of learning and teaching (LoLT). ESL learners' performance-related difficulties may increase when linguistic complexity is added to auditory comprehension tasks. Limited research is available on the auditory skills of ESL learners and listening comprehension in ESL learners younger than 12 years. Aim: To determine which areas of auditory skills and listening comprehension Grade 1 ESL learners find most difficult. Setting: The study was conducted at two independent primary schools in an urban setting of the Tshwane district, Gauteng province, South Africa where the LoLT is English. Methods: A static two-group comparison design was used. Data were collected from two similar independent urban schools. The research group comprised ESL learners (n = 15) exposed to English for 12-18 months. The control group comprised English first language (EFL) learners (n = 15). The digits-in-noise (DIN), children's auditory processing performance scale (CHAPPS) and listening comprehension test 2 (LCT-2) were used. Six Grade 1 teachers participated in this study. Results: Majority of the participants (n = 25) passed the DIN test. In the overall scores for the CHAPPS and LCT-2, significant differences were found between the two groups (p = 0.024; p = 0.001). Strong agreements were found between the ESL participants' test results for the CHAPPS and LCT-2. Results indicate that ESL learners experience significant difficulties with higher linguistically dependent auditory skills and listening comprehension tasks. Conclusion: ESL learners achieved poorer scores as the listening tasks became more linguistically demanding. Specific layers of auditory skill and listening comprehension difficulties when listening in their LoLT were identified in the ESL learners. Targeted intervention and curriculum support with the help of a speech-language therapist can be provided.\n",

Firstly, the study investigates an impact that different levels of metaphorical competence may have on interpretation of target idioms. Secondly, the study investigates whether an elucidation technique, which includes a mapping of the literal meaning of target idioms on correct figurative meaning, facilitates the interpretation of unfamiliar idioms. The study concluded that learners with lower levels of metaphorical competence were more likely to interpret idioms literally. In addition, although the technique proved to be effective for all levels, learners with lower levels of metaphorical competence benefited more from the dual-coding technique.

We randomly assigned participants (L1 = 92; L2 = 88) to one of four conditions: pre-reading instruction, where participants' received explicit instruction on six novel items and read a text with the items repeated eight times; reading-only, where participants simply read the same text with the novel items repeated eight times; reading-baseline, where participants read the same text with the repeated items replaced by known (control) words; and instruction-only, where participants received explicit instruction on the novel items and read an unrelated text. Eye-tracking was used to measure amount of attention to the vocabulary during reading. We assessed knowledge of the target vocabulary in three immediate posttests (form recognition, meaning recall, and meaning recognition). Results showed that pre-reading instruction (plus reading the text) led to both more vocabulary learning and a processing advantage. Cumulative reading times were a significant predictor of meaning recognition scores.\n",

Determining what words to select in order to satisfy the goals of the course and what instructional methodology best suits the purpose of vocabulary learning are not easy tasks. Even more difficult is dealing with the formulaic terminology of a domain-specific vocabulary that students have not previously encountered. In this paper, I describe a criminalistics module within a Legal Spanish course that has a mock trial as a final assignment. In order to learn the terminology for the final assignment, incidental vocabulary learning through reading, watching a movie, and listening to a talk was seen as complementary, but not sufficient. Instead, intentional vocabulary learning has proven more effective because it reinforces retention of novel vocabulary and leads to its eventual production in the final task.

Based on Self-Determination Theory (SDT), questionnaires were developed and data were collected from students and their teachers in twelve English language classrooms around Thailand. In addition, each lesson was observed by two observers. The data were triangulated and used to describe the students' motivation and learning and the teacher's motivational strategies in each class. The findings showed that most students had a relatively high level of motivation and many reported having internal interests in learning English; however, the level of learning was not assessed to be as high. Furthermore, a few students in almost every class showed a lack of motivation. The teachers were found to employ a variety of motivational strategies, including autonomy-support and controlling styles. While autonomy controlling strategies were commonly used in these classes, autonomy-support strategies were found only in highly motivated and high performing classrooms. The findings from this study suggest the use of strategies that do not only initialize but also nurture students' internal motivation in order to enhance sustainable learning of English in and outside the classroom; therefore, research on how motivation theories are deployed in teacher education programs should be further undertaken.\n",

From earliest childhood, active listening is perceived as an ability that helps a child to develop sensitivity to facilitate the acquisition of many skills, not only related to music. This assumption should lead to the list of the most idiomatic determinants -- the elements of a specific &quot;dialogue&quot; between a musical piece and a &quot;listener-learner&quot;: the child. The question whether multi-stimulating senses of a child and the development of sensitivity to Art leads to easier assimilation of a foreign language as well as leads to the general assimilation of information remains flowing and open. The idea of applying classical music to foreign language teaching draws on recent research into the interrelation of expression, verbal emotions and mood in the fields of musical perception and foreign language learning. The features of a musical piece are discussed in the context of intuitive and active listening to music against the techniques and methods used in foreign language teaching in early childhood such as &quot;total immersion,&quot; as well as in the context of linking emotional reactions to music to early vocabulary acquisition. The author hopes to provoke further research into musical properties which may influence the methodology in the above mentioned area.\n",

The results provide further evidence that some strategies can transfer across contexts. However, unlike previous studies, it was found that Korean teachers attach very little importance and hardly ever use strategies related to generating a positive classroom climate and adaptive group dynamics. Furthermore, and unique to this study, virtually all the examined strategies were underused relative to their perceived importance, suggesting that motivating students is very low on Korean teachers' list of priorities.

      "Document: Teaching writing is the frustrating part of teaching English as a second language, yet a secondary-school level student who is literate in his own language can be guided into writing a simple paragraph in English soon after he can read one. Guided writing limits the variety of errors a student can make, gives repeated practice in using a selected sentence pattern correctly, prepares a student to write freely with a manageable number of errors, and allows him to write confidently with no fear of unpleasant surprises. Transformation, insertion, completion, and change-in-point-of-view oral exercises can easily be adapted to guided writing. Copying, generally recommended as the first step in writing English, may be skipped if the student can already write in the Roman alphabet.  Dictation, the next step, may begin with the teacher reading a very short sentence which the students repeat aloud and then write. (The teacher then rereads it.) This is followed by \"standard paragraph dictation,\" which the student hears four times. A writing teacher should (1) work on one structure at a time, (2) substitute oral practice for grammatical explanations, (3) assign one or more guided exercises which practice the structure, (4) assign a topic which makes the use of the structure likely, and (5) provide the topic sentence until the student can do so on his own.

      "Document: An investigation of the naturalistic acquisition of a second language phonology, based on the case of a native Icelandic speaker learning the fricatives and affricates of English, reveals that neither transfer hypothesis nor the developmental hypothesis alone provides an adequate explanation of second language phonological development. This development is best accounted for by a systematic interaction between general processes of phonological development and transfer from the native language. Transfer best predicts the order of difficulty of English fricatives and affricates, while the developmental hypothesis best predicts sound substitution for difficult segments. The pattern of interaction between transfer from the native language and developmental processes noted for  fricatives and affricates may be somewhat different for other types of phonological segments. Finally, variability--in language models, among different language learners, and in an individual child's production--is a complicating factor for any detailed analysis of phonological development. Several ways are suggested of taking these types of variability into account in future studies of second language phonological acquisition. (Author/JB)\n",

Two studies explored language users' intuitions about three types of word combinations: free combinations, collocations, and idioms. In Study 1, Italian Verb+Noun combinations were embedded in sentential contexts, with control conditions created by substituting the verb with a synonym. L1 and L2 speakers rated sentence acceptability. In Study 2, the original verb was removed from sentences. Participants chose the verb from the list provided they felt was most acceptable. Computational measures were used to measure compositionality of word combinations. Mixed-effects modelling revealed that L1 and L2 speakers judged target word combinations differently in terms of lexical fixedness. In line with phraseological models, L1 speakers judged the use of a synonym as less acceptable in collocations than free combinations. On the contrary, L2 learners judged the use of a synonym as more acceptable in collocations than free combinations. However, all participants perceived idioms as least flexible of the three combination types. Results further showed an interesting effect of compositionality on the speakers' intuitions about the use of word combinations. Taken together, the findings provide new insights into how L1 and L2 speakers perceive word combinations that vary along the continua of lexical fixedness and compositionality.\n",

However, despite the growing popularity of self-assessment in interpreter training and education, very limited evidence-based research has been initiated to shed insight into the formative assessment of language interpretation. This longitudinal study was therefore conducted to investigate to what extent student self-assessments of English-Chinese interpretation are accurate and how the accuracy level would change over time. Major findings are: (1) in general self-assessment accuracy improved over time for both interpreting directions; (2) regarding the three scoring dimensions of information completeness, fluency of delivery and target language quality, there was greater self-assessment accuracy for English-to-Chinese interpretation than in the other direction; (3) while information completeness was most accurately self-assessed in English-to-Chinese direction, the pattern was reversed in the opposite direction; and (4) the students tended to over-score the three quality dimensions for Chinese-to-English interpretation at each time point.

Professional counselors have experienced the pain and oppression of linguicism in their own lives and in the lives of their family members, students, colleagues, and clients. In this paper ideas, guidelines, and resources for advocating against linguicism are presented. In terms of advocacy, linguicism is defined as prejudice multiplied by power used by members of dominant language groups against non-dominant language groups. Although found worldwide, this paper focuses on linguicism in the United States. This paper presents numerous examples of linguicism experienced by the authors personally  and examples encountered by counselors within their professional interactions. It is suggested that in order to operationalize multicultural competencies for counselors, those in the profession need to affirm languages and bilingualism, to question and challenge dominant culture/languages, and to consider how these variables may affect nondominant language client-colleagues.

The study also aimed to examine how raters with different backgrounds could develop their rating ability over time. For this purpose, raters' background characteristics were first explored in regard to (1) experience in rating L2 speaking assessments, (2) TESOL experience, (3) rater training accompanied with rating experience, and (4) relevant coursework completed. Raters were classified into novice, developing, and expert groups accordingly in order to examine the extent to which the three rater groups exhibited different scoring behaviors in each of the three rating sessions, which were separated by a one-month interval. Each rater group's changes in rating patterns were also investigated across the rating sessions.    In each of the three rating sessions, the three groups of raters scored a set of pre-recorded speaking responses to five semi-direct placement speaking tasks with an analytic scoring rubric. The raters also recorded how they arrived at certain scoring decisions while rating examinee responses on the first two tasks. Before each rating session the raters were trained, and before the second and third rating sessions they were provided with individual feedback on their previous rating performance.    The three groups of raters' analytic ratings were statistically analyzed in the first phase of the study, focusing on severity, internal consistency, and interaction effects. Statistically, the novice and developing rater groups did not show distinctive rating patterns, especially in regard to interaction effects, while the expert raters displayed the highest rating ability across the three rating sessions. However, in the second phase of the study, in which the raters' verbal reports were qualitatively analyzed focusing on their use of the given scoring criteria, the three groups of raters displayed different rating patterns and developmental paths across the three rating session's. The findings from this study suggest that the different weaknesses that the three rater groups exhibited need to be addressed through individual or group rater training to help raters improve rating ability, and ultimately to minimize rater effects.

It represents a first step in exploring a widely held assumption that L2 readers of English can easily identify proper names by their form and function. The study isolates the issue of function to investigate whether context alone allows identification of proper names. Context may be especially important to the identification of proper names for readers processing a different orthography from their first language (L1), as there is no research indicating that the initial capital letter on English proper names facilitates proper name recognition in L2 readers. Japanese L2 low intermediate readers of English (N = 61) were given sentences in lower-case letters. Target items had a proper name usage and a common word meaning (e.g. Rose, rose). Participants were asked to identify proper names by changing lower-case letters to upper case. Participants correctly identified target proper names in 28% of cases. The findings contradict an assumption in L2 reading and vocabulary research that proper names are easily understood from context. Implications for research and pedagogy are discussed.\n",

      "Document: Comprehending a text involves constructing a coherent mental representation of it and deep comprehension of a text in its entirety is a critical skill in academic contexts. Interpretations on test takers' ability to comprehend texts are made on the basis of performance in test tasks but the extent to which test tasks are effective in directing test takers towards reading a text to understand the whole of it is questionable. In the current study, tests based on multiple choice items are investigated in terms of their potential to facilitate or preclude cognitive processes that lead to higher level reading processes necessary for text level macrostructure formation. Participants' performance in macrostructure formation after completing a multiple choice test and a summarization task were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. Task performances were compared and retrospective verbal protocol data were analyzed to categorize the reading processes the participants went through while dealing with both tasks. Analyses showed that participants' performance in macrostructure formation of the texts they read for multiple choice test completion and summarization task differed significantly and that they were less successful in comprehending the text in its entirety when they were asked to read to answer multiple choice questions that followed the text. The findings provided substantial evidence of the inefficacy of the multiple choice test technique in facilitating test takers' macrostructure formation and thus pointed at yet another threat to the validity of this test technique.\n",

      "Document: The present study used event related potentials (ERPs) to investigate how native (L1) German-speaking second-language (L2) learners of English process sentences containing filler-gap dependencies such as &quot;Bill liked the house (women) that Bob built some ornaments for __ at his workplace.&quot; Using an experimental design which allowed us to dissociate filler integration from reanalysis effects, we found that fillers which were implausible as direct objects of the embedded verb (e.g. &quot;built the women&quot;) elicited similar brain responses (an N400) in L1 and L2 speakers when the verb was encountered. This confirms findings from behavioral and eye-movement studies indicating that both L1 and L2 speakers immediately try to integrate a filler with a potential lexical licensor. L1/L2 differences were observed when subsequent sentence material signaled that the direct-object analysis was in fact incorrect, however. We found reanalysis effects, in the shape of a P600 for sentences containing fillers that were plausible direct objects only for L2 speakers, but not for the L1 group. This supports previous findings suggesting that L2 comprehenders recover from an initially plausible first analysis less easily than L1 speakers.\n",

      "Document: We used a data set with n = 1,603 learners of foreign languages (FL) to develop and validate the short form of the Foreign Language Enjoyment Scale (S-FLES). The data was split into 2 groups, and we used the first sample to develop the short-form measure. A 3-factor hierarchical model of foreign language enjoyment (FLE) was uncovered, with FLE as a higher-order factor and with teacher appreciation, personal enjoyment, and social enjoyment as 3 lower-order factors. We selected 3 items for each of the 3 lower-order factors of the S-FLES. The proposed 9-item S-FLES was validated in the second sample, and the fit statistics for the factor structure indicated close fit. Further evidence was found to support the internal consistency, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the S-FLES. The S-FLES provides a valid and reliable short-form measure of FLE, which can easily be included in any battery of assessments examining individual differences in FL learning.\n",

      "Document: Native English speakers tend to exclude regular plural inflection when producing English noun-noun compounds (e.g., \"rat-eater\" not \"rats-eater\") while allowing irregular plural inflection within compounds (e.g., \"mice-eater\") (Clahsen, 1995; Gordon, 1985; Hayes, Smith & Murphy, 2005; Lardiere, 1995; Murphy, 2000). Exposure to the input alone has been considered insufficient to explain this dissociation between regular and irregular plurals in compounds because naturally occurring compounds in English rarely have plurals of any type included within them (e.g., Gordon, 1985). However, the constraint on the production of plural inflection in English compounds could be derived from the patterns in which regular plural and possessive morphemes occur in the input. To explore this idea, native adult English speakers and adult Chinese learners of English were asked to process a series of compounds containing different medial morphemes and phonemes. Comparisons were made across compounds with regular and irregular plurals and possessive [-s]. Native speakers (NS) of English processed compounds with medial possessive morphology faster than compounds with medial regular plural morphology. The second language learners did not show the same pattern as the NSs, which could be due to the fact that they had considerably less exposure to the relevant input patterns relative to the NSs. Regular plurals may be excluded before a rightmost noun in English because the pattern \"Noun--[-s] morpheme--Noun\" is more frequently used for marking possession in English. Irregular plurals do not end in the [-s] morpheme and therefore do not \"compete\" with the possessive marker and, consequently, may be optionally included in compounds. It is possible, therefore, that the input English learners receive could indeed be sufficient to constrain this aspect of English compound production. (Contains 2 figures and 3 tables.)\n",

In providing multicultural and multilingual library services for immigrants, Ledbetter was active locally as librarian at the Broadway Branch of the Cleveland Public Library and member of the Cleveland Americanization Committee and nationally as chair of the American Library Association's Committee on Work with the Foreign Born. She was recognized internationally as a bibliographer of Polish literature and translator of Czech folktales, for which she was awarded honors by the Polish and Czechoslovak governments, and as an unofficial ambassador for the American public library in eastern and southeastern Europe, specifically the countries of the former Yugoslavia.\n",

      "Document: For a testing program with frequent administrations, it is important to understand and monitor the stability and fluctuation of test performance across administrations. Different methods have been proposed for this purpose. This study explored the potential of using multilevel analysis to understand and monitor examinees' test performance across administrations based on their background information. Based on the data of 330,091 examinees' test scores and their background information collected from 254 administrations of an English-speaking test, the study found: (a) at the individual examinee level, examinees' background had statistically significant relationships with their test performance, and the relationships varied across administrations; however, the prediction of individuals' test scores based on their background variables was not strong, and (b) at the administration level, group composition had strong relationships with administration means; the prediction of administration means based on group composition variables was fairly strong.The results suggest that multilevel analysis has potential application in understanding and monitoring test performance across administrations by identifying statistical relationships between examinees' characteristics and their test performance at both individual and administration levels.\n",

      "Document: This article examines the effect of phonological context (singleton vs. clustered consonants) on full phoneme segmentation in Hebrew first language (L1) and in English second language (L2) among typically reading adults (TR) and adults with reading disability (RD) (n = 30 per group), using quantitative analysis and a fine-grained analysis of errors. In line with earlier findings, overall mean scores revealed significant differences between the two groups. However, no qualitative differences were found. In both groups and languages, full phoneme segmentation overall scores for CVC stimuli were higher than CCVC stimuli. This finding does not align with previous findings, obtained from a phoneme isolation task, showing that isolation from a cohesive CV unit is the most difficult. A fine-grained analysis of errors was conducted to glean insight into this finding. The analysis revealed a preference for creating and preserving CV units in phoneme segmentation in both L1 and L2. This is argued to support the cohesion of the CV unit. The article argues that the effect of language-specific sub-syllabic representations on phonemic analysis may not be always observed in overall scores, yet it is reflected in specific patterns of phonological segmentation errors.\n",

       " 'description': ['The Melbourne Declaration recognises the place of ICT in education by it being both a general capability (GC) and a learning area conceptually placed under the umbrella of Technologies. This dual recognition acknowledges the shift to a knowledge-based society and the need for all students to acquire and apply a depth and breadth of ICT knowledge, skills, attitudes, values and ethics in order for them to be successful learners, workers and active citizens. Currently there is no published curriculum documentation for ICT competence as a GC. Rather its place in the Australian Curriculum is recognised within each of the four published learning areas, English, Mathematics, Science and History through embedding in content descriptors and/or achievement standards and through an introductory paragraph explaining the role of ICT in that learning area. This paper discusses four key concerns about the current ICT situation and proposes and justifies a solution whereby ICT would be a learning area in its own right, either within the framework of the Technologies or as a new learning area.

However, the present research focuses only on the tools, i.e., Smart Boards, tablets/laptops, and Moodle (online learning management system). Modern English language teachers utilize English Preparatory School, BS, and Master in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Moreover, the present qualitative and observational research examines the role of technology utilized at the English Preparatory School in Cyprus International University to teach English to the learners who learn English as a Second Language. For the present research, data are collected through two interviews from the teachers who teach at Cyprus International University (CIU) and from an in-depth literature review. Through the findings, the researchers observe that: a) all the teachers in TRNC utilize technology, i.e., Smart Boards, tablets, and Moodle; b) technology helps the English Language Learners (ELLs) to enhance their language skills; c) teachers and students who utilize technology in language learning process face technical challenges due to lack of knowledge or less familiarity with the technology. Hence, the present research would explore the pros and cons of technology and intend to know a teacher interested in teaching language through technology.\",\n",

       "  'Although bilingual education has been offered in some schools of Sri Lanka since 2001, primary and secondary school education has been conducted mainly in the first language (L1), that is, Sinhala/Tamil. As a result, most students sit for the General Certificate of Education -- Advanced Level (GCE (A/L) examination, which determines university entry, in their L1. Thus, the majority of students entering state universities do so after receiving their entire education in their L1. At the tertiary level, where many (if not most) degree programs are conducted in the English medium, students struggle to make the transition from Sinhala/Tamil medium instruction to English medium instruction (EMI).1This study examines the challenges faced by students and lecturers in three selected state universities due to this language transition. It employs a qualitative research design. Data were collected through official documents and semi-structured interviews with forty academics. Three focus group interviews were conducted with thirty undergraduates. In addition, eighteen non-participant lectures were observed in mainstream2 classrooms. The findings indicate several structural, institutional, and linguistic challenges on the way to a successful implementation of EMI in state universities and demonstrate that the transition from GCE (A/L) to EMI in universities is a challenging experience for both students and lecturers. We propose that the concept of academic literacies be used as a productive means of supporting undergraduates through their transition to EMI.',\n",

Specifically, this review focuses on the affordances of digital tools to foster uses of digital literacies of informational/accessibility, collaboration knowledge construction, multimodal communication, gaming literacy, and reflection on learning. Researchers have found relatively high levels of students' engagement through their uses of digital tools for the social purposes of accessing, sharing, communicating, and reflecting on knowledge as part of a shared learning commons. Students are also engaged in multimodal representations of knowledge for immediate and worldwide audiences, as well as participation in collaborative gaming activities for both acquiring knowledge and learning collaboration practices. Researchers have also found that teachers and students employ uses of digital feedback tools and e-portfolios for effectively fostering student reflection. The findings from the research reviewed suggest the need for teachers to identify the affordances of digital tools in ways that remediate and transform largely print-based learning in English language arts classrooms through uses of digital tools.\",\n",

While nothing has yet been resolved, it still bears some study since developmental education is an important function for most community colleges.    This study adds to the current data of the success of students who take developmental courses. Most of the studies done on the topic of developmental education focus on the comparison between students who had remediation with those who did not. There is not much data that compares the type of instruction given in remedial courses and how the different types of instruction affect student learning outcomes. This study compared two different methods of instructional delivery in a developmental English classroom, straight lecture based classrooms and classes where some type of technology was used to deliver course material, and evaluated the learning outcomes for each class.

       "  \"This report provides baseline data on professional development and training needs for teachers of less commonly taught languages (LCTLs). Surveys administered to LCTL teachers working in higher education addressed a range of issues relating to the following: the teaching context; the teacher's professional background and qualifications; the teacher's current job situation; and perceived professional development needs. Overall, enrollment levels in LCTL classes varied considerably. Class sizes tended to be small. The highest reported enrollment in advanced classes was in Italian. Many students were heritage speakers of the languages. Often, students had specific research interests in their language. A growing trend in some LCTLs with large heritage groups was to offer courses  tailored to that group, segregating rank beginners from those with at least some exposure. A common complaint among teachers was that LCTL materials were outdated. However, for many languages, new materials had been published in the 1990s. Most teachers worked full time, held tenured or tenure-track positions, and had a Ph.D. degree. Relatively few had extensive preparation specifically in pedagogy. Five professional development needs noted were advocacy for teachers, information about professional issues, opportunities for collaboration, information about technology use, and e-mail list-servs. (Contains 10 references.)

       "  'Language learning is a form of cultural learning, and cultural learning embraces language learning. The goal of cultural learning is a continuing search for understanding that bridges cultures. Language can be a bridge, a system that constructs reality as it communicates about reality. Education in the U.S. has tended to define culture as American culture, and so has institutionalized ethnocentrism. To change this approach, significant reforms in teaching are needed: (1) language teachers should no longer call their subject foreign, because this practice engenders prejudice; (2) teachers need more substantial training in semantics, kinesics, proxemics, sociology, anthropology, ethnography, and communications theory; (3) literature should be learned as culture rather than as  criticism; (4) meaning must be combined with grammar, and function with form; (5) language teaching must take into account that the American university model of knowledge and authority may not correspond to that of other countries; and (6) methods and materials should be more geared to what is current and real in other countries.

They all come from different social and academic backgrounds and their knowledge of English language varies from one another. A mixed ability group throws many challenges to an English language teacher teaching to a grown up or rather adult group of learners who always pre-define their interests and needs. The primary and the most important challenge in front of the language teacher teaching engineering students is--how to promote active learning in a MAC situation? A language teacher to overcome the problems of a mixed ability classroom and promote active learning needs to adopt a number of strategies.

Our analysis suggests that these new tests will hold secondary English teachers accountable for literacy and disciplinary knowledge outside the field of English and thus raise important questions about what English teachers should, can and will do, especially when their jobs are on the line.',\n",
       "  \"This dissertation explored how a teacher learned to teach with and about unfamiliar (to her) media texts in her high school English classroom. This study also examined my role as the researcher/mentor in the teacher's learning and development process. Through situated learning theories (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991) and discourse through identities (Gee, 2001; 2014a) theoretical frameworks, this study explored the ways the teacher accepted, resisted, and enacted her figured worlds and identities as an English teacher. Historically, texts in the English classroom consist of novels, poems, plays, and the occasional nonfiction book or essay, and English teacher education and development often keeps these texts at the center of English teachers' content knowledge. However, research exploring students' use of multiliteracies in out-of-classroom contexts advocates for a multiliteracies perspective within classrooms. Still, there is a lack of professional development opportunities for teachers to support multiliteracies practices in their classrooms. Further, teachers' professional development is often provided in stand-alone experiences where teachers learn outside of their classroom teaching contexts. Taking place over a six-month time frame, this study is situated as one-on-one professional development mentoring and included researcher and teacher collaboration in multiple contexts including planning, teaching, and reflection. This qualitative case study (Merriam, 1998) sought to address a gap in the literature in how the collaboration of teachers and researchers impacted teacher learning. Using interpretive analysis (Erickson, 1986) and discourse analysis (Gee, 2014a; 2014b) I developed two assertions: (1) The process the teacher underwent from finding resources to teaching and reflection was complex and filled with many phases and challenges, and (2) I, as the researcher/mentor, served as a sounding board and resource for the teacher/learner throughout her process of learning about, teaching with, and reflecting on unfamiliar texts. Findings of this study indicate the teacher's identities and figured worlds impacted both how she learned about and taught with unfamiliar texts, and how I approached my role as a researcher/mentor in the study. Further, findings also indicate collaborative, practice-based research models (Hinchman &amp; Appleman, 2017) offer opportunities to provide teachers meaningful and impactful professional development experiences situated in classroom contexts.

These high school students were engaged in the study of local fresh water ecology with their teacher, the researcher. Transcribed audiotapes of students' discourse, their illustrated guides to macroinvertebrates, their macroinvertebrate indices for two fresh water locations, their power point presentations of findings, and transcribed interviews with three focus students were utilized as data. Findings indicated that, for the most part, students were provided opportunities to enact scientific practices and communications and that they did indeed do so. More specifically, students learned to identify questions and concepts that guide ecology research, formulate and revise scientific explanations using logic and evidence, and communicate scientific arguments. However, students were not provided adequate opportunities to practice defending the scientific arguments they constructed and communicated. They also struggled at times to use scientific language. I close with recommendations for teaching and for conducting qualitative research with English Language Learners in science.

       "  'It is generally accepted that second language (L2) acquisition becomes more difficult as one grows older and that success in adult L2 acquisition is highly variable. Nevertheless, humans in language contact situations have to cope with intergroup communication. This article examines the ways society has responded to this challenge. It describes eleven strategies or workarounds that humans use to deal with this problem: developing lingua francas, forming Sprachbunds, practicing exogenous marriage, undergoing language shift, learning the target language imperfectly, developing a pidgin or creole, shifting the learning burden to children, relying on individual differences in aptitude among learners, developing the art and practice of translation, developing machine translation technology, and providing instruction. The eleven strategies can be understood as involving four broad societal responses to the burden of SLA: to simplify the learning task, to create a simpler language, to leave it to a special set of learners, and to provide special training. Finally, the article offers some speculations about the evolutionary reasons for the difficulties experienced in adult L2 acquisition. (Contains 2 notes.)',\n",

       "  \"English language teaching (ELT) publishing as we know it today has a long and lucrative history, dating, according to Rix (2008), from the Longman publication of Michael West's &quot;New Method Readers&quot; in 1926, to the present day, where annual turnover runs to around US$194 billion (Jordan &amp; Gray, 2019). Some of the sector's best-sellers, such as Oxford University Press's &quot;Headway&quot; series (Soars &amp; Soars), have sold over 70 million copies (Ozóg, 2018) with OUP's &quot;English File&quot; (Latham-Koenig, Oxenden, &amp; Lambert) selling over a million copies in China alone. Generally speaking, it is taken for granted that commercial publications in the educational sector are based on sound, accepted pedagogical principles. Early language teaching publications (from the 1950s onwards) naturally reflected practices that were thought to promote language learning at that time--such as repetition, drills and sentence-level grammar exercises. As our understanding of language learning developed, this Structural approach gave way to a Communicative one, reflecting the 1970s preoccupation with the importance of communicative competence, influenced by theorists such as Hymes (e.g. 1972) and Halliday (e.g. 1975). This approach remains the predominant one (in the West at least) 50 years later. It represents, remarkably perhaps, the last time that applied linguistics substantially influenced a language teaching approach, or at least, one that had such global reach and enduring influence. Since then, findings from the fields of applied linguistics and second language (L2) acquisition, which should have fed into language learning approaches and hence language coursebooks, have been slow to do so in any systematic or significant way. Where they have, the way in which language learning theory 'translates' into pedagogy in the coursebook and thence classroom, can be questionable. In parallel with this is the problem of the socio-cultural standpoint of teaching materials of an international language such as English, issuing from a particular geographic heartland, viz. England. As with applied linguistics and L2 acquisition research, developments in sociolinguistic, socio-cultural and socio-political theory have been realised in language teaching coursebooks only as a rather superficial multi-cultural gloss. The advent of 'global' coursebooks conceived in the 1990s, with multiple iterations, attempting to capture international appeal, still has not resolved the conundrum that language--and hence language teaching materials, that is, the combination of content and pedagogy--constitute cultural artefacts, imbued with cultural values and ideologies. All in all, as Timmis, Mukundan, and Alkhaldi laconically observe: 'for such commonplace objects, [coursebooks] have aroused a surprising degree of controversy' (2009, p. 11). These then, are the chief areas of contention that I will develop in this article. Opposing these issues, it will be acknowledged that coursebooks remain the default language learning resource, and that teachers and learners world-wide need, want and value them as ready-made language teaching materials.\",\n",

Data was collected from a single group of participants who participated in eight sessions based on the use of CAAM in their writing processes. A Self-Regulation of Learning Scale (SRS) was utilized to identify the students' awareness of their self-regulation of learning. The results reveal that the CAAM method used by the respondents made noteworthy gains on their argumentative writing performance across task achievement, coherence-cohesion, lexical resource and grammatical range and accuracy, as indicated by a significant difference between their pre- and post- test results. Furthermore, four out of six components of SRS reveal a significant relationship with their writing performance indicative that the respondents have become more cognizant of their self-regulation in terms of planning, self-monitoring, effort and self-efficacy. Finally, qualitative findings reveal that the respondents had positive feelings about using CAAM in their writing processes as well as enhanced their awareness on their self-regulation of learning.\",\n",

The mechanics of English composition are categorized into specific areas of competence; these categories form the basis for three tracks, taught simultaneously throughout the quarter. Students are assigned to that track in which their writing reveals them to be most deficient; at the end of each ten-week cycle, students are retested and may be reassigned to the same track or assigned to a different one. In evaluative questionnaires completed by students, 78% of students have indicated preference for the track method over the regular lecture method. In an effort to evaluate the approach analytically, a study was made to determine whether  students taught by this method in the first quarter of freshman English would earn higher grades in the second quarter than would students taught by the traditional method. Analysis of the results indicated that students taught by the track approach tended to be better prepared for the second quarter course and that the track method is equally effective with students of verbal ability above or below the median of their peers.

Instruction in English as a second language (E.S.L.) and native language arts, in addition to bilingual instruction in mathematics, science, and social studies, was provided to approximately 60 Spanish-speaking students of LEP. Also program students were assigned to an all-English exploratory vocational course to expose them to a variety of occupations. In 1983-84, curriculum development was delayed by the late arrival of Title VII funds,  but program staff conducted extensive research on materials related to job survival skills, translated materials from English textbooks, and designed five student workshops on career awareness. Staff development activities included a pre-service orientation, monthly meetings, attendance at demonstration lessons, outside workshops professional conferences, and university courses. Efforts to involve parents in school activities were generally unsuccessful, so the program's parental involvement component was established as a priority for its second year. To improve the program's overall effectiveness, it is recommended that: (1) student achievement data be collected; (2) teacher-training activities be conducted on the role of the paraprofessional in the vocational classroom, teaching Spanish  as a native language, and developing teacher-made materials; (3) more space be allocated to separate tutoring and couseling from administration activities; (4) teachers not acquainted with bilingual education be better informed; and (5) efforts be made to improve parent involvement.

       "  \"Using tape cassettes in evaluating student writing takes less time to cover more comments than does writing comments. It also allows for more personal contact with students and permits a teacher to indicate more adequately how errors can be corrected. One helpful technique is for the teacher to leave the tape recorder on while trying to provide a correction to an awkward sentence, thereby allowing the student to hear the teacher trying various ways of correction before deciding on the most satisfactory one. This gives students a chance to hear how writing is generated and to gain some courage from hearing the teacher's struggle to write.

In addition, the classroom fanfiction texts were compared with comparable online writing published in the fanfiction site Archive of Our Own (Ao3) to identify thematic and stylistic differences. The results showed that students' lack of familiarity with publishing in blogs often posed a challenge that some groups were able to overcome or exploit to facilitate or enhance the readability of their completed stories. Compared to online fanfiction, the classroom fanfiction was less innovative with respect to focal characters yet more collective in its focus, with stories being told from multiple characters' perspectives.\",\n",

       "  \"Translanguaging, the movement between communicative modes and features of different languages, is becoming an established research tradition in content-focused second language learning contexts. Pedagogic translanguaging practices nevertheless remain under-applied and under-researched in foreign language instructional settings, whether face-to-face or online. Synchronous virtual foreign language classrooms represent particularly rich spaces in which to begin to explore such practices, due to their multimodal affordances on the one hand and their technical constraints on the other. This study examines the pedagogic translanguaging practices that occur in a corpus of beginner-level Spanish online group tutorial data. A macro-level analysis of the interactional patterns that occur within this context reveals that both teacher participants follow closely the pedagogic prescriptions provided by the course designers with regard to the activities they employ. The finding that these activities offer limited opportunities for students to move between communicative modes and languages may be attributed in part to the emphasis on spoken interaction in this particular setting. A complementary micro-level analysis nevertheless reveals a more autonomous and intuitive approach to the teachers' choice of language when mediating such activities. Instances of student code-switching are relatively few, however. The study concludes with a call to course designers and practitioners to experiment with integrating a wide range of pedagogic translanguaging opportunities into online foreign language classroom activities, with a view to enhancing teaching, learning and communication in such environments.\",\n",

They were requested to rate the quality of the teachers and to point out and describe the criteria they used to rate the teachers. Content analysis of the data indicated that preparation, caring, classroom management, and instruction constituted the general criteria the native and non-native teachers employed to evaluate teacher quality. Considerable differences, however, were observed between the two groups regarding a few of the criteria. The native teachers valued teachers' efficient use of learners' L1 more than the non-native teachers, while teachers' linguistic accuracy and fluency of speech were highlighted by more non-native teachers. Besides, issues related to caring, management, and instruction grabbed the attention of both native and non-native teachers, while preparation received substantially less attention. It can be concluded that the use of video-mediated peer observation can provide a platform to uncover the implicit beliefs teachers hold toward teacher quality.\",\n",
       "  'This paper points out that students who earn a Ph.D. in English in a conventional literary curriculum are often totally ignorant of linguistics, rhetoric, and current research in the teaching and learning of composition. Yet such knowledge is invaluable for many reasons. Graduate students can become more accurate critics of their own writing, if they can make use of some of the tools of linguistic or rhetorical analysis. They can become more skillful literary critics and better teachers of both literature and writing. Furthermore, fully one-half of the teaching jobs currently available at the college level include the teaching of composition; therefore, at least one-half of the English doctoral students who plan to teach in four-year colleges and universities ought to have some  formal instruction in composition. The paper lists the aims of a graduate concentration in composition, both for M.A. and Ph.D. candidates, and makes a few general suggestions for curriculum requirements for a minor or major in composition. Finally, the paper examines ways in which staffing can be provided for such programs and discusses other resources which the programs might draw on. (GW)',\n",
       "  \"Children are thought to learn second languages (L2s) using primarily implicit mechanisms, in contrast to adults, who primarily rely on explicit language learning. This difference is usually attributed to cognitive maturation, but adults also receive more explicit instruction than children, which may influence their learning strategies. This study crosses instruction condition with age, teaching forty children aged 5;3 to 7;11 and forty adults an artificial mini-language under implicit or explicit training conditions. Participants produced novel sentences and judged sentence grammaticality equally well in either condition, but both children and adults in the explicit training condition developed greater awareness of the mini-language's structures--and greater awareness was associated with better performance for both age groups. Results show that explicit instruction affects children and adults in the same way, supporting the hypothesis that age differences in implicit vs. explicit L2 learning are not exclusively caused by maturation, but also influenced by instruction.\",\n",

Therefore, the effective use of LLSs is determined by various factors, including both learning and learner variables. This dynamic and complex nature of LLSs renders it appropriate to use a qualitative approach to undertake research into this issue. This paper details the qualitative findings from a larger-scale study on English LLSs among tertiary students in the context of Vietnam. The data was gathered from semi-structured interviews with 10 English as a foreign language (EFL) teaching staff and 10 EFL students at a university in Vietnam. Interviews were conducted in Vietnamese lasting 30 to 40 minutes, and were audio recorded with consent. The interview questions for students focussed on their general attitudes and lived experiences of LLSs. Similarly, the interview questions for EFL staff were structured around their general attitudes. The interview data were translated into English, rechecked, and thematically analysed. The findings are of a textual and interpretative nature with emerging themes and issues related to the attitudes towards and actual use of LLSs among the target learners. The findings provide practical implications for practitioners, researchers and educational policy makers alike.',\n",

       "  \"This article is about current policy in the coordination of opportunities for adult migrants in England to learn English. People who move to a different country experience a need to learn the dominant language of their new environment, to support their settlement. A willingness to learn the language is a marker of social inclusion from a political perspective too: an insistence that migrants have an obligation to learn and use the language is a recurrent trope in political and media discourse. In the UK, language education for adult migrants focuses on the area of education known as ESOL, English for Speakers of Other Languages. Beyond the rhetoric, policy support for migrants' learning of English across the UK is inconsistent: there is neither a UK-wide nor an England-specific strategy in policy to support access to ESOL. Where policy exists, it is formed at a local level in the absence of national direction. The aim of this paper is to consider how an important area of adult education appears to have little presence in national policy, and what the implications of this are, for practice. To achieve this, we first follow the trajectory of ESOL policy in England, considering why--despite attempts to address its coordination--there remains a lacuna. Second, we ask what the implications are of this policy gap for ESOL coordination in practice. Analysis of current policy and of interviews with key ESOL stakeholders suggests an enduring condition of fragmentation and lack of coordination to the detriment of students.\",\n",

A survey was first conducted to show the absence of Intercultural Communication in higher education, as well as the need for incorporating exercises and activities that stress the importance of communicating to people from different cultures, and respecting their differences. Two classes involving intercultural communication activities were then given to two groups of Japanese students who were studying English in a Japanese university.

       "  \"With the increasingly significant role that English language teaching (ELT) is playing in Asian contexts, it is important to gain a better understanding of the use of English as a medium of intercultural communication in Asia. In doing so, ELT practices may be better able to adapt themselves to the intercultural communicative needs of local contexts. This paper argues that an essential element in fostering successful intercultural communication is developing cultural awareness as part of ELT pedagogy. To illustrate this, a case study of Thailand is presented examining English use, English teaching policy and practice, and local cultural attitudes towards ELT. This then leads to suggestions on how locally relevant intercultural communicative practices can form part of ELT classroom pedagogy in Thailand with the aim of developing learners' cultural awareness. It is argued that similar analyses may be applied to other Asian contexts, which may share features with the Thai context. This can lead to the development of teaching practices, which through engaging learners in intercultural reflection will result in English language users who are better able to manage intercultural communication through English.

Two types of data, small group text discussions and oral interviews, were gathered. The results indicated that participants used diverse sources of intertextual links, and with such links they were able to inquire more about what they were reading within a broader framework that went beyond merely discussing the story itself. Three patterns of interactive talk were identified, namely collaborative, complementary and conflicting, which functioned to share, negotiate and conflict meaning, respectively, and an investigation of these showed that intertextuality not only allowed students to become more involved in idiosyncratic responses, but also offered more opportunities for students to judge and reshape their responses by genuinely considering others' opinions and idea. Pedagogical implications for classroom practices are also discussed. (Contains 2 tables.)\",\n",

The curriculum is divided into four main strands: native language, second language, concept development, and cultural awareness. The two investigators were teachers working as a team integrating the four strands at each grade level (kindergarten to three) during the period 1969 to 1975. The program has among its major aims the development of coordinate bilingualism not only for the Spanish-speaking Mexican-American student but for his native English-speaking peer as well. The major  conclusions reached in this study are: (1) a strong commitment to a maintenance philosophy of bilingual education approached in a team-teaching manner has created the environment for the Spanish language that allows coordinate bilingualism to develop; (2) the two separate language environments and models have encouraged students to use the languages independently of each other, thus producing a higher degree of bilingualism; (3) strong native language development has been shown to be the key to second language acquisition; and (4) Anglo students have become progressively more bilingual.

       "  \"In this paper, a Chinese character educational system based on Kinect is proposed for guiding beginners to learn the basics of Chinese characters in a more intuitive way. It extracts 19 common components, denoted as alphabets, from Chinese characters. Nineteen postures were designed according to the shapes of these alphabets. Instead of memorizing Chinese characters through repetitive copying, students can first associate an alphabet with the corresponding designed posture. Then, they break down a Chinese character into a set of alphabets in order to perform the sequence of corresponding postures so that they can easily remember the whole character. Our proposed system contains two major functions: 1) the learning function that is responsible for delivering the courseware, and 2) the testing function that is used to let students acquire their learning progress through some tests. A rule-based algorithm is designed to recognize the students' input postures captured from the Kinect motion sensor so as to determine whether the students have performed the correct postures. We conducted a survey which involved 90 students to try our proposed system as well as two other learning modes for comparison. Moreover, we have interviewed those 30 students who had tried our proposed system with some open-ended questions. The positive results show that the proposed system can promote students' experiences in learning Chinese characters.\",\n",

Working in concert with language which stresses the tight deadlines the students are obliged to meet, methodological \"I\" can promote the researcher by highlighting their resourcefulness in managing to get their project completed on schedule.

However, even when the students feel obliged to record their procedural failures, methodological \"I\" can help them create a favourable impression on the reader by constructing them as tenacious neophytes whose repertoire of computing skills has increased considerably as a result of working on their research project.

In our research we investigated the differences in the motivational and intercultural contact measures as well as determinants of motivated behaviour between learners of English and German. Our results indicate that students of English have a more positive attitude towards the native speakers of the language they study than learners of German, and children who study English have higher levels of linguistic self-confidence, invest more energy into language learning and receive more support from their environment than students of German. Our findings also reveal that learners of English experience more frequent direct written contact and contact through media products than learners of German. For both groups of language learners the results indicate that students with high levels of motivational intensity engage in various types of intercultural contact more frequently than students who invest less energy into language learning.

By drawing on Bourdieu's concept of distinction and specifying the processes of distinction into &quot;replacement,&quot; &quot;opposition,&quot; and &quot;addition,&quot; this paper clarifies the ideological construction and effects of oral communicative competence in English through an ethnographic analysis of post-secondary learners studying English in a study abroad context. Influenced by South Korea's recruitment culture, these learners distinguish primarily between learning English for standardized tests in South Korea and learning English for authentic communication while studying abroad. However, the efforts of learners who have studied abroad to develop their oral English skills bear limited fruit in South Korea's recruitment culture, which does not fully appreciate the value of the job seeker's experience of having studied English abroad. Thus, the limits of distinction function to impose the burden of English learning on individual learners.\",\n",

The experimental group received metadiscourse instruction, while the control group received no instruction. At the end of the treatment, both groups took part in the speaking posttest. The results indicated that the speaking performance of the experimental group was significantly higher than the control group. In addition, the comparison of the pretest and posttest of the experimental group proved an improvement in their speaking ability; while the same comparison in the control group didn't suggest any improvement.

This study compares an extensive reading class against a more traditional class involving intensive reading and vocabulary exercises. The classes were part of a Saudi college presessional course, and this classroom setting posed several problems for the extensive reading approach, including relatively weak students, an environment where pleasure reading is atypical, and the course being of short duration. The result is that the reported extensive reading class was carried out in what could be considered challenging conditions. Nevertheless, gain scores in reading comprehension ability, reading speed, and vocabulary acquisition showed that the extensive reading approach was just as effective as the intensive approach, even though some of the measurement instruments for these variables should have favored the intensive approach. Moreover, the extensive reading participants reported much more positive attitudes toward reading, their class, and their learning than the participants in the intensive reading group. Overall, these results indicate that, for the variables studied, the extensive reading approach was as good as, or better than, the more focused intensive reading approach.

This article reports on measures by which teachers of elementary-age YLLs use the students' OL in a systematic fashion to create an optimally rich NL environment. Successful elementary teachers of English as a foreign language in Japan and of Japanese as a foreign language in the United States were selected and observed, and classroom OL use practices enabling clear and engaging use of the NL were documented. Teachers made extensive use of signals for the use of the students' OL within routines for classroom management to reduce student confusion.

Proper assessment of English learners is essential for progress monitoring, determining language proficiency, predicting achievement, and identifying students with disabilities. However, because of linguistic and cultural factors, traditional norm-referenced standardized tests of achievement may not be valid for language minority students. In light of these issues, as well as the growing gap in achievement between language minority and language majority students, greater accountability in the education of English learners is needed. This article delineates some of the challenges in the assessment of English learners in schools, reviews studies that have used curriculum-based measurement with English learners, and outlines the usefulness of such an approach as part of a problem-solving model with this population.

Contributions of different linguistic grain sizes (i.e., small grains assessed via phonological decoding and large grains assessed via morphological awareness), mediators (i.e., word reading, listening comprehension, and oral vocabulary), and transfer were explored. The results suggest that morphological awareness and phonological decoding contributed to reading comprehension in Spanish whereas only morphological awareness contributed to reading comprehension in English. For mediators, listening comprehension played a larger role than word reading in supporting reading comprehension in Spanish and English, but oral vocabulary only contributed in Spanish. No significant role of cross-language transfer was found. Theoretical and educational implications are discussed.',\n",

The potential role of using such an approach was assessed in terms of students' attitudes towards learning English. Five authentic animated stories were used as overarching themes into which some basic vocabulary, structures, and functions of the target language were integrated. On the whole, the outcome of the study is that students kept their initial positive attitudes towards learning English with animated stories.

An experimental group of 36 future English teachers at DePaul University was compared with a control group of 36 similar students at Loyola University, a school with a parallel English Education program. The independent variable was the special composition course taught at DePaul. The two test instruments developed to measure the effect of the special course were the &quot;Examination in English Composition for Secondary School English Teachers&quot; and the &quot;Scale for Rating Teaching of English Composition.&quot; Although the tests revealed no statistically significant performance differences between the two groups, the  expeimental group, which was below the control group in English grade point total, did as well as its counterpart. The equal test scores apparently resulted from the small sample involved and the complexities of administrative arrangements for the experiment.

Also investigated are the language ideologies and the linguistic culture animating language management practices through which conservation of the heritage language and culture is pursued. One central finding is that despite strong affiliations to Arabic and active efforts to maintain Arabic skills in younger UK-born individuals of Yemeni heritage there appears to be a shift underway towards English-dominant bilingualism in this younger generation. There remains, however, considerable variability between individuals in language repertoires and Arabic language proficiency, and this significantly qualifies generalisations about language shift. The paper also comments on the secular and religious discourses found in discussions of the reasons for complementary school attendance, and on the efforts made by parents to secure the home as an Arabic-speaking space. The paper concludes with the observation that this study of a Yemeni community helps highlight a diversity within the UK Muslim population that popular discourses tend to overlook.

Surprisingly, nonverbal tests not only led to more classification errors but also failed to identify more English language learners and minority students.

Language policies can influence decisions about teaching methodologies either directly, by making explicit recommendations about the methods to be used in classroom practice, or indirectly, through the conceptualisation of language learning which underlies the policy. It can be argued that all language policies have the potential to influence teaching methodologies indirectly and that those policies which have explicit recommendations about methodology are actually functioning of two levels. This allows for the possibility of conflict between the direct and indirect dimensions of the policy which results from an inconsistency between the explicitly recommended methodology and the underlying conceptualisation of language teaching and learning which informs the policy.',\n",

It may be used in an intensive, full-time training program, a non-intensive program, or for home-study with individual tape recorders. The materials provide for four stages of learning--Workbook 1 involves the development of speech habits (the sound features and intonational  patterns) in English, and the building of an &quot;acoustic imagery&quot; of the language. Workbook 2 conditions the making of automatic responses, for the development of fluency and naturalness. Workbooks 3, 4, and 5 involve the process of vocabulary development and control of grammatical structures. Workbook 6 concentrates on techniques of stimulating the learner into generating English speech forms. Other publications in the Collier-Macmillan English Program (e.g., English 900 Series) may be used in correlation with this series. Details are given in the Teacher's Guide. (AMM)\",\n",

       "  \"The present article examines how a group of Norwegian pre-service teachers of English and other foreign languages perceived the term &quot;cultural diversity&quot; when student-centred learning activities were used. A qualitative inquiry, comprising data retrieved from three student-centred activities: student narratives, role-playing, and focus group discussion are thematically analysed. Theoretical concepts from translation theory are applied to discuss students' perceptions of cultural diversity. The translation of the term in the student-centred learning activities led to individual and collaborative reflection in which controversial connotations and ethical dilemmas were debated. In the student narratives, conventional connotations were appraised; however, differing aspects were emphasized. When role-playing was used, the students' interpretations were more emotive. The students tended to cast the role of teacher in the majority cultural position, thereby impeding the possibility to view the term in a wider perspective. In the focus group discussion, the students' multifarious comprehensions regarding cultural diversity were debated.\",\n",
       "  \"Native speakers of English have a strong preference for transferred negation as opposed to non-transferred negation. The present study aims to examine whether young Chinese-speaking ESL learners have a target-like preference for transferred negation and whether they have a system-wide representation of transferred negation in their early English development. Based on the corpora compiled with longitudinal data of a Chinese-speaking child learning English as a second language, the present study analyzed the child's collocation of matrix verbs with transferred negation and non-transferred negation, the distribution of matrix verbs in transferred negation, and the distribution of negation types in terms of different matrix verbs. The findings show that the verb THINK predominates the matrix verbs of the child's transferred negation. The imbalanced distribution of matrix verbs in his transferred negation is related to the skewed input of verbs. In sentences with the matrix verb THINK, the child has a target-like preference for transferred negation as opposed to non-transferred negation. However, he does not show a target-like preference for transferred negation in sentences with the matrix verb LOOK LIKE. Hence, we argue that young ESL learners' generalizations about constructions are focused around particular verbs that occur frequently in those constructions. Young ESL learners do not have an abstract system-wide representation at the earliest stage of second language acquisition. Instead, their ESL acquisition is based on specific verbs.\",\n",
       "  \"The paper deals with the experience of a group of Chinese teachers of English studying on ELT/Applied Linguistics-related MA courses at a London university. Drawing mainly on data from questionnaires, it shows how the early part of their stay was marked by surprise, disappointment and disorientation at the diversity and perceived poor quality of the Englishes they encountered. It is suggested that this &quot;language shock&quot; can be attributed in large part to the students' lack of sociolinguistic awareness, in that they expected London speech to provide a model of &quot;good&quot; English, in line with their perceptions of Beijing Chinese. They also expected to hear only &quot;good&quot; English within a university, and were surprised to hear lecturers with regional accents, associating non-RP accents with non-standard forms of the language. Given that these kinds of experience are unlikely to be restricted solely to Chinese students, or even to those studying in London, it is recommended that some sociolinguistic awareness-raising be built into UK universities' EAP provision. This would enable overseas students to understand better the new linguistic environment in which they find themselves, and thus to become more effective and productive learners, more quickly.\",\n",
       "  'Examples of cross cultural misunderstandings are examined in this paper to show how cultural (contextual) meaning must be regarded as an integral feature of the overall semantic meaning of an utterance. The examples, taken from the Filipino dialect Tagalog, illustrate how ignorance of the cultural assumptions and attitudes associated with an utterance may well lead to misunderstanding and conflict. What is noteworthy about these examples is that, although they are commonplace and conventional, they conceal a dimension of meaning as long as the Tagalog speaker communicates with other Tagalog speakers, either in English or in Tagalog. When the speaker talks with a native speaker of English, however, potential problems not entirely obvious to either the speaker or the hearer may  occur because the speaker uses lexical equivalents in the target language and the hearer adds a cultural dimension of meaning. For these reasons, foreign language instructors should insist on having cultural notes and comments included in second language learning texts and activities. (RL)',\n",

Then they were equally distributed in two control and experimental groups and received a validated pretest of reading aloud and speaking in English. Afterward, the treatment was performed in 18 sessions by singing preselected songs culled based on some criteria such as popularity, familiarity, amount, and speed of speech delivery, etc. In the end, the posttests of reading aloud and speaking in English were administered. The results revealed that the treatment had statistically positive effects on the connected speech aspects of English learners' speech production at statistical 0.05 level of significance. Meanwhile, the results represented that there was not any significant difference between the experimental group's mean scores on the posttests of reading aloud and speaking. It was thus concluded that providing the EFL learners with English verbal songs could positively affect connected speech aspects of both modes of speech production, reading aloud and speaking. The Findings of this study have pedagogical implications for language teachers to be more aware and knowledgeable of the benefits of verbal songs to promote speech production of language learners in terms of naturalness and fluency.\",\n",

       "  \"This paper proposes &quot;perceptual multilingualism&quot; as a research interest within the broader folk linguistic enterprise. By drawing on the geolinguistic mapping tasks popular in perceptual dialectology -- whereby participants are asked to draw and depict dialectal diversity in a given region -- we show that perceptual multilingualism can elicit knowledge and reasoning in the community about linguistic diversity more broadly. To do this, we analysed and discussed 41 perceptual multilingualism maps produced by high school students in Hong Kong about societal multilingualism across the Hong Kong region. On the one hand, the maps allowed us to quantify which languages manifest in the youths' metalinguistic awareness and where. On the other hand, we positioned the maps as discourses to be compared and analysed through a critical social theoretical lens. Doing so revealed implicit and contested power relations as they manifested in epistemic claims in dialectic relation to broader sociopolitical narratives in Hong Kong. This included Hong Kong's contentious transition to governance by Beijing and the marginalisation of the blue-collar workforce. Beyond the empirical metalinguistic data, our paper shows that perceptual multilingualism can contribute to critical sociolinguistics by helping to reveal power relations, hegemonies and ideologies, and resistance.\",\n",

       "  \"Background: Studies indicate that difficulties English second language (ESL) learners experience in the classroom may not be attributed to only listening comprehension of the language of learning and teaching (LoLT). ESL learners' performance-related difficulties may increase when linguistic complexity is added to auditory comprehension tasks. Limited research is available on the auditory skills of ESL learners and listening comprehension in ESL learners younger than 12 years. Aim: To determine which areas of auditory skills and listening comprehension Grade 1 ESL learners find most difficult. Setting: The study was conducted at two independent primary schools in an urban setting of the Tshwane district, Gauteng province, South Africa where the LoLT is English. Methods: A static two-group comparison design was used. Data were collected from two similar independent urban schools. The research group comprised ESL learners (n = 15) exposed to English for 12-18 months. The control group comprised English first language (EFL) learners (n = 15). The digits-in-noise (DIN), children's auditory processing performance scale (CHAPPS) and listening comprehension test 2 (LCT-2) were used. Six Grade 1 teachers participated in this study. Results: Majority of the participants (n = 25) passed the DIN test. In the overall scores for the CHAPPS and LCT-2, significant differences were found between the two groups (p = 0.024; p = 0.001). Strong agreements were found between the ESL participants' test results for the CHAPPS and LCT-2. Results indicate that ESL learners experience significant difficulties with higher linguistically dependent auditory skills and listening comprehension tasks. Conclusion: ESL learners achieved poorer scores as the listening tasks became more linguistically demanding. Specific layers of auditory skill and listening comprehension difficulties when listening in their LoLT were identified in the ESL learners. Targeted intervention and curriculum support with the help of a speech-language therapist can be provided.\",\n",

Firstly, the study investigates an impact that different levels of metaphorical competence may have on interpretation of target idioms. Secondly, the study investigates whether an elucidation technique, which includes a mapping of the literal meaning of target idioms on correct figurative meaning, facilitates the interpretation of unfamiliar idioms. The study concluded that learners with lower levels of metaphorical competence were more likely to interpret idioms literally. In addition, although the technique proved to be effective for all levels, learners with lower levels of metaphorical competence benefited more from the dual-coding technique.

In order to learn the terminology for the final assignment, incidental vocabulary learning through reading, watching a movie, and listening to a talk was seen as complementary, but not sufficient. Instead, intentional vocabulary learning has proven more effective because it reinforces retention of novel vocabulary and leads to its eventual production in the final task.

Based on Self-Determination Theory (SDT), questionnaires were developed and data were collected from students and their teachers in twelve English language classrooms around Thailand. In addition, each lesson was observed by two observers. The data were triangulated and used to describe the students' motivation and learning and the teacher's motivational strategies in each class. The findings showed that most students had a relatively high level of motivation and many reported having internal interests in learning English; however, the level of learning was not assessed to be as high. Furthermore, a few students in almost every class showed a lack of motivation. The teachers were found to employ a variety of motivational strategies, including autonomy-support and controlling styles. While autonomy controlling strategies were commonly used in these classes, autonomy-support strategies were found only in highly motivated and high performing classrooms. The findings from this study suggest the use of strategies that do not only initialize but also nurture students' internal motivation in order to enhance sustainable learning of English in and outside the classroom; therefore, research on how motivation theories are deployed in teacher education programs should be further undertaken.\",\n",
       "  'The author explores the interdisciplinary use of music in teaching English as a foreign language to children in the context of function, genre, character and expression, trying to decipher the role and influence of music on various contexts of language learning, such as memory and concentration span, and takes under consideration a wide variety of musical aspects. From earliest childhood, active listening is perceived as an ability that helps a child to develop sensitivity to facilitate the acquisition of many skills, not only related to music. This assumption should lead to the list of the most idiomatic determinants -- the elements of a specific &quot;dialogue&quot; between a musical piece and a &quot;listener-learner&quot;: the child. The question whether multi-stimulating senses of a child and the development of sensitivity to Art leads to easier assimilation of a foreign language as well as leads to the general assimilation of information remains flowing and open. The idea of applying classical music to foreign language teaching draws on recent research into the interrelation of expression, verbal emotions and mood in the fields of musical perception and foreign language learning. The features of a musical piece are discussed in the context of intuitive and active listening to music against the techniques and methods used in foreign language teaching in early childhood such as &quot;total immersion,&quot; as well as in the context of linking emotional reactions to music to early vocabulary acquisition. The author hopes to provoke further research into musical properties which may influence the methodology in the above mentioned area.',\n",

The study reported in this paper builds on the work of Dornyei and colleagues (Dornyei and Csizer, 1998; Cheng and Dornyei, 2007).

The results provide further evidence that some strategies can transfer across contexts. However, unlike previous studies, it was found that Korean teachers attach very little importance and hardly ever use strategies related to generating a positive classroom climate and adaptive group dynamics. Furthermore, and unique to this study, virtually all the examined strategies were underused relative to their perceived importance, suggesting that motivating students is very low on Korean teachers' list of priorities.

       "  'Teaching writing is the frustrating part of teaching English as a second language, yet a secondary-school level student who is literate in his own language can be guided into writing a simple paragraph in English soon after he can read one. Guided writing limits the variety of errors a student can make, gives repeated practice in using a selected sentence pattern correctly, prepares a student to write freely with a manageable number of errors, and allows him to write confidently with no fear of unpleasant surprises. Transformation, insertion, completion, and change-in-point-of-view oral exercises can easily be adapted to guided writing. Copying, generally recommended as the first step in writing English, may be skipped if the student can already write in the Roman alphabet.  Dictation, the next step, may begin with the teacher reading a very short sentence which the students repeat aloud and then write. (The teacher then rereads it.) This is followed by \"standard paragraph dictation,\" which the student hears four times.

       "  \"An investigation of the naturalistic acquisition of a second language phonology, based on the case of a native Icelandic speaker learning the fricatives and affricates of English, reveals that neither transfer hypothesis nor the developmental hypothesis alone provides an adequate explanation of second language phonological development. This development is best accounted for by a systematic interaction between general processes of phonological development and transfer from the native language. Transfer best predicts the order of difficulty of English fricatives and affricates, while the developmental hypothesis best predicts sound substitution for difficult segments. The pattern of interaction between transfer from the native language and developmental processes noted for  fricatives and affricates may be somewhat different for other types of phonological segments. Finally, variability--in language models, among different language learners, and in an individual child's production--is a complicating factor for any detailed analysis of phonological development. Several ways are suggested of taking these types of variability into account in future studies of second language phonological acquisition. (Author/JB)\",\n",

Two studies explored language users' intuitions about three types of word combinations: free combinations, collocations, and idioms. In Study 1, Italian Verb+Noun combinations were embedded in sentential contexts, with control conditions created by substituting the verb with a synonym. L1 and L2 speakers rated sentence acceptability. In Study 2, the original verb was removed from sentences. Participants chose the verb from the list provided they felt was most acceptable. Computational measures were used to measure compositionality of word combinations. Mixed-effects modelling revealed that L1 and L2 speakers judged target word combinations differently in terms of lexical fixedness. In line with phraseological models, L1 speakers judged the use of a synonym as less acceptable in collocations than free combinations. On the contrary, L2 learners judged the use of a synonym as more acceptable in collocations than free combinations. However, all participants perceived idioms as least flexible of the three combination types. Results further showed an interesting effect of compositionality on the speakers' intuitions about the use of word combinations.

However, despite the growing popularity of self-assessment in interpreter training and education, very limited evidence-based research has been initiated to shed insight into the formative assessment of language interpretation. This longitudinal study was therefore conducted to investigate to what extent student self-assessments of English-Chinese interpretation are accurate and how the accuracy level would change over time. Major findings are: (1) in general self-assessment accuracy improved over time for both interpreting directions; (2) regarding the three scoring dimensions of information completeness, fluency of delivery and target language quality, there was greater self-assessment accuracy for English-to-Chinese interpretation than in the other direction; (3) while information completeness was most accurately self-assessed in English-to-Chinese direction, the pattern was reversed in the opposite direction; and (4) the students tended to over-score the three quality dimensions for Chinese-to-English interpretation at each time point.

Professional counselors have experienced the pain and oppression of linguicism in their own lives and in the lives of their family members, students, colleagues, and clients. In this paper ideas, guidelines, and resources for advocating against linguicism are presented. In terms of advocacy, linguicism is defined as prejudice multiplied by power used by members of dominant language groups against non-dominant language groups. Although found worldwide, this paper focuses on linguicism in the United States. This paper presents numerous examples of linguicism experienced by the authors personally  and examples encountered by counselors within their professional interactions. It is suggested that in order to operationalize multicultural competencies for counselors, those in the profession need to affirm languages and bilingualism, to question and challenge dominant culture/languages, and to consider how these variables may affect nondominant language client-colleagues.

       "  \"The purpose of the study was to investigate the extent to which raters coming from diverse backgrounds exhibited different levels of rating ability while scoring speaking performances. The study also aimed to examine how raters with different backgrounds could develop their rating ability over time. For this purpose, raters' background characteristics were first explored in regard to (1) experience in rating L2 speaking assessments, (2) TESOL experience, (3) rater training accompanied with rating experience, and (4) relevant coursework completed. Raters were classified into novice, developing, and expert groups accordingly in order to examine the extent to which the three rater groups exhibited different scoring behaviors in each of the three rating sessions, which were separated by a one-month interval. Each rater group's changes in rating patterns were also investigated across the rating sessions.    In each of the three rating sessions, the three groups of raters scored a set of pre-recorded speaking responses to five semi-direct placement speaking tasks with an analytic scoring rubric. The raters also recorded how they arrived at certain scoring decisions while rating examinee responses on the first two tasks. Before each rating session the raters were trained, and before the second and third rating sessions they were provided with individual feedback on their previous rating performance.    The three groups of raters' analytic ratings were statistically analyzed in the first phase of the study, focusing on severity, internal consistency, and interaction effects. Statistically, the novice and developing rater groups did not show distinctive rating patterns, especially in regard to interaction effects, while the expert raters displayed the highest rating ability across the three rating sessions. However, in the second phase of the study, in which the raters' verbal reports were qualitatively analyzed focusing on their use of the given scoring criteria, the three groups of raters displayed different rating patterns and developmental paths across the three rating session's. The findings from this study suggest that the different weaknesses that the three rater groups exhibited need to be addressed through individual or group rater training to help raters improve rating ability, and ultimately to minimize rater effects.

       "  'This study investigated how well second language (L2) readers of English use context to identify proper names as such. It represents a first step in exploring a widely held assumption that L2 readers of English can easily identify proper names by their form and function. The study isolates the issue of function to investigate whether context alone allows identification of proper names. Context may be especially important to the identification of proper names for readers processing a different orthography from their first language (L1), as there is no research indicating that the initial capital letter on English proper names facilitates proper name recognition in L2 readers. Japanese L2 low intermediate readers of English (N = 61) were given sentences in lower-case letters. Target items had a proper name usage and a common word meaning (e.g. Rose, rose). Participants were asked to identify proper names by changing lower-case letters to upper case. Participants correctly identified target proper names in 28% of cases. The findings contradict an assumption in L2 reading and vocabulary research that proper names are easily understood from context. Implications for research and pedagogy are discussed.',\n",

       "  \"Comprehending a text involves constructing a coherent mental representation of it and deep comprehension of a text in its entirety is a critical skill in academic contexts. Interpretations on test takers' ability to comprehend texts are made on the basis of performance in test tasks but the extent to which test tasks are effective in directing test takers towards reading a text to understand the whole of it is questionable. In the current study, tests based on multiple choice items are investigated in terms of their potential to facilitate or preclude cognitive processes that lead to higher level reading processes necessary for text level macrostructure formation. Participants' performance in macrostructure formation after completing a multiple choice test and a summarization task were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. Task performances were compared and retrospective verbal protocol data were analyzed to categorize the reading processes the participants went through while dealing with both tasks. Analyses showed that participants' performance in macrostructure formation of the texts they read for multiple choice test completion and summarization task differed significantly and that they were less successful in comprehending the text in its entirety when they were asked to read to answer multiple choice questions that followed the text. The findings provided substantial evidence of the inefficacy of the multiple choice test technique in facilitating test takers' macrostructure formation and thus pointed at yet another threat to the validity of this test technique.\",\n",
       "  'The present study used event related potentials (ERPs) to investigate how native (L1) German-speaking second-language (L2) learners of English process sentences containing filler-gap dependencies such as &quot;Bill liked the house (women) that Bob built some ornaments for __ at his workplace.&quot; Using an experimental design which allowed us to dissociate filler integration from reanalysis effects, we found that fillers which were implausible as direct objects of the embedded verb (e.g. &quot;built the women&quot;) elicited similar brain responses (an N400) in L1 and L2 speakers when the verb was encountered. This confirms findings from behavioral and eye-movement studies indicating that both L1 and L2 speakers immediately try to integrate a filler with a potential lexical licensor. L1/L2 differences were observed when subsequent sentence material signaled that the direct-object analysis was in fact incorrect, however. We found reanalysis effects, in the shape of a P600 for sentences containing fillers that were plausible direct objects only for L2 speakers, but not for the L1 group. This supports previous findings suggesting that L2 comprehenders recover from an initially plausible first analysis less easily than L1 speakers.',\n",
       "  'We used a data set with n = 1,603 learners of foreign languages (FL) to develop and validate the short form of the Foreign Language Enjoyment Scale (S-FLES). The data was split into 2 groups, and we used the first sample to develop the short-form measure. A 3-factor hierarchical model of foreign language enjoyment (FLE) was uncovered, with FLE as a higher-order factor and with teacher appreciation, personal enjoyment, and social enjoyment as 3 lower-order factors. We selected 3 items for each of the 3 lower-order factors of the S-FLES. The proposed 9-item S-FLES was validated in the second sample, and the fit statistics for the factor structure indicated close fit. Further evidence was found to support the internal consistency, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the S-FLES. The S-FLES provides a valid and reliable short-form measure of FLE, which can easily be included in any battery of assessments examining individual differences in FL learning.',\n",

       "  'Native English speakers tend to exclude regular plural inflection when producing English noun-noun compounds (e.g., \"rat-eater\" not \"rats-eater\") while allowing irregular plural inflection within compounds (e.g., \"mice-eater\") (Clahsen, 1995; Gordon, 1985; Hayes, Smith & Murphy, 2005; Lardiere, 1995; Murphy, 2000). Exposure to the input alone has been considered insufficient to explain this dissociation between regular and irregular plurals in compounds because naturally occurring compounds in English rarely have plurals of any type included within them (e.g., Gordon, 1985). However, the constraint on the production of plural inflection in English compounds could be derived from the patterns in which regular plural and possessive morphemes occur in the input. To explore this idea, native adult English speakers and adult Chinese learners of English were asked to process a series of compounds containing different medial morphemes and phonemes. Comparisons were made across compounds with regular and irregular plurals and possessive [-s]. Native speakers (NS) of English processed compounds with medial possessive morphology faster than compounds with medial regular plural morphology. The second language learners did not show the same pattern as the NSs, which could be due to the fact that they had considerably less exposure to the relevant input patterns relative to the NSs. Regular plurals may be excluded before a rightmost noun in English because the pattern \"Noun--[-s] morpheme--Noun\" is more frequently used for marking possession in English. Irregular plurals do not end in the [-s] morpheme and therefore do not \"compete\" with the possessive marker and, consequently, may be optionally included in compounds. It is possible, therefore, that the input English learners receive could indeed be sufficient to constrain this aspect of English compound production. (Contains 2 figures and 3 tables.)',\n",

       "  \"For a testing program with frequent administrations, it is important to understand and monitor the stability and fluctuation of test performance across administrations. Different methods have been proposed for this purpose. This study explored the potential of using multilevel analysis to understand and monitor examinees' test performance across administrations based on their background information. Based on the data of 330,091 examinees' test scores and their background information collected from 254 administrations of an English-speaking test, the study found: (a) at the individual examinee level, examinees' background had statistically significant relationships with their test performance, and the relationships varied across administrations; however, the prediction of individuals' test scores based on their background variables was not strong, and (b) at the administration level, group composition had strong relationships with administration means; the prediction of administration means based on group composition variables was fairly strong.The results suggest that multilevel analysis has potential application in understanding and monitoring test performance across administrations by identifying statistical relationships between examinees' characteristics and their test performance at both individual and administration levels.\",\n",
       "  'This article examines the effect of phonological context (singleton vs. clustered consonants) on full phoneme segmentation in Hebrew first language (L1) and in English second language (L2) among typically reading adults (TR) and adults with reading disability (RD) (n = 30 per group), using quantitative analysis and a fine-grained analysis of errors. In line with earlier findings, overall mean scores revealed significant differences between the two groups. However, no qualitative differences were found. In both groups and languages, full phoneme segmentation overall scores for CVC stimuli were higher than CCVC stimuli. This finding does not align with previous findings, obtained from a phoneme isolation task, showing that isolation from a cohesive CV unit is the most difficult. A fine-grained analysis of errors was conducted to glean insight into this finding. The analysis revealed a preference for creating and preserving CV units in phoneme segmentation in both L1 and L2. This is argued to support the cohesion of the CV unit. The article argues that the effect of language-specific sub-syllabic representations on phonemic analysis may not be always observed in overall scores, yet it is reflected in specific patterns of phonological segmentation errors.',\n",
