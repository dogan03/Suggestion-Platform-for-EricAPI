       "[\"Technology has undergone a lot of radical changes in the last years which have caused the implemention of new paradigms in different sectors. It is almost impossible for education not to be affected from this change in technology. It has shifted from the traditional applications to the technology use in the classrooms. In this case, teachers' role in the application of technology into education has become an essential part of the research in the field. Also, in higher education, teachers become the key factors to the effective use of technology in the teaching and learning processes. Thus, teachers' technology acceptance level remains an important issue. The term, technology acceptance refers to the adoption and use of technologies in the way they were designed for. The purpose of this study is to examine the technology acceptance level of teachers at Anadolu University School of Foreign Languages to test the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) that determines the variables influencing individuals' technology acceptance. Firstly, a Likert scale type of scale was administered to measure UTAUT and the attitudes of teachers towards technology. The participants are the 44 lecturers who have started using technology recently at Anadolu University School of Foreign Languages. The findings reveal that the overall technology acceptance level of participants is average.\",\n",
       " \"Students become more actively involved in their studies when teachers integrate ICT into their lessons. Since computer self-efficacy is positively related to the integration of technology in education, improving pre-service teachers' computer self-efficacy could increase their intention to use technology. The present study explores the association between computer self-efficacy (basic technology skills, advanced technology skills, and technology for pedagogy) and pre-service teachers' intentions to use technology (traditional use of technology and constructivist use of technology). Data collected from 267 Bahrain Teachers College students were used to validate the questionnaires using confirmatory factor analysis. The Structural equation modeling approach was used to explore the hypothesized relationships. Mediation analysis was also performed, and the results indicated that basic technology skills and advanced technology skills mediated the relationship between technology for pedagogy and the traditional use of technology. Advanced technology skills did not mediate the relationship between technology for pedagogy and constructivist use of technology.\",\n",

The research outcomes suggested that, despite the fact that there is a common consensus among geography teachers that the use of technology is highly beneficial for teaching and learning processes and the use of technology must be maximized for ideal geography education, there are some gaps that must be addressed by all shareholders in geography education; about half of the respondents suffer from a lack of technological infrastructure in their schools and almost one-third of them disagree with or are noncommittal about the suggestion that they have enough knowledge to integrate the necessary competences in the use of technology. The results indicated however, that the 2005 program affected geography education in a positive way, by encouraging the use of technology in geography courses especially in the public schools. Additionally, increasing English level of the teachers also affects their beliefs about the importance of technology use in geography courses and their competence in using technology in an affirmative way.

       " 'This study looks at how three middle school teachers of English as a second language (ESL) use technology in the classroom. Technology use in the ESL classroom has the potential of supporting the English and content learning of English language learners, but the availability of technology does not necessarily lead to technology integration that supports student learning. Teacher attitudes and beliefs toward technology as well as lack of time and adequate resources may deter teachers from integrating technology in their lessons. The researcher conducted teacher interviews and classroom observations of each of the language arts classes taught by three ESL teachers. Available technology at the classroom, ESL department, and school levels was diverse: digital boards, overhead projectors for the digital boards, document cameras, laptops, desktops, iPods, iPads, and internet connection for all the devices. The teachers seemed to be comfortable users of the available technology despite scarce training, lack of time and technology support, and several episodes of technology malfunction. However, the use of technology could be expanded. The researcher makes several recommendations, such as additional time for planning lessons that use technology and further professional development related to technology use.',\n",

This study used the survey responses of 280 English as foreign language (EFL) teachers to examine how two key external factors (ie, school culture and professional development) interact with the two constitutive internal components (ie, knowledge/skill and belief) to determine three types of technology use in teaching and learning (ie, technology for content delivery, technology for learning enrichment and technology for transformed education towards self-directed learning). It identified the salience of school culture, professional development and TPACK over teaching and learning beliefs in determining technology use. It further revealed that these factors influenced the three types of technology use differently.

This is the case of Tunisia where a stand-alone in-service teacher education (Ted) initiative was implemented in 2014 and 2015. The aim of this project, the Tech Age Teacher Project (TATP), was to equip teachers in Tunisia with the technology skills for teaching so that they can dispense teaching of a 21st-century education quality. Five English language teachers, who benefitted from this initiative, are the focus of this study. The aim was to explore whether and how they are making the transition into the technologically-challenged schools. Analysis of the TATP documents, data is collected through a short teacher questionnaire and a semi-structured interview during which teachers give their personal accounts as TAT trainees and their attempts to apply the ideas in real school settings. Results indicated that teachers showed great dedication toward implementing the ideas/skills received in the training and that they strove, as technology-capable teachers, to integrate technology in their day-to-day practice despite the constraints they faced in the schools. Their accounts reveal their rationale and motives for using technology with their students and the strategies they employ to circumvent obstacles, but also show that their success in integrating technology remains restricted by issues of infrastructure, barred access to a technology space, learners' &quot;playful&quot; attitudes, etc. The findings highlight these teachers' resourcefulness and sense of mission as to transforming their learners' learning experience and changing their attitudes towards technology use and to fostering 21st-century education learning goals. The paper concludes with recommendations for future initiatives to (re)design and (re)orient the goals of the initiative towards supporting these teachers' learning processes as they make the transition as technology-capable teachers into the technology-challenged schools. Recommendations are made for the emerging professional community of technology-capable teachers to build a networked community of practice likely to foster these teachers' reconstruction of their professional knowledge and skills and to facilitate the dissemination of ideas on the integration of technology in education.\",\n",
       " \"Technology including social media and other technology applications enabled by different technology devices offer many possibilities for second language learners to improve their learning, if they are interested in doing so. We investigated purposes for using technology among urban adolescents, including both English language learners (ELLs) and native English speakers (NESs). Data were collected through a survey of 531 students in an urban public middle school in the USA. The results showed that students used technology for diverse purposes regardless of their first language background. Although overall technology students' access was comparable to national averages, the use of technology for many specific purposes was markedly lower, lending support to the notion of a new digital divide between students from high- and low-income families based on technology knowledge and meaningful application of such knowledge rather than mere access. Student reports of their own English skills were related to various specific uses of technology, e.g., blogging and email. These relationships were stronger for ELLs, particularly those in grade 6, than for NESs. The results suggest that younger ELL adolescents may be more aware of their language constraints and prone to use technology in certain ways than their NES peers. These findings provide some preliminary insights into the complex relationships between language skills and student preferences for technology use and can ultimately provide guidance for the integration of technology into language and literacy instruction for linguistically diverse urban adolescents.\",\n",

An exploratory mixed methods design was employed by interviewing 20 EFL teachers about the role of technology in teachers' creativity and administering a creativity questionnaire to 175 teachers. The findings revealed that teachers are aware of the importance of technology in creativity. Technology appears to help them explore their creativity and encourages learners' creativity in a way that it helps transfer their creativity into reality, makes the activities more authentic, and provides teaching materials on various topics. However, there is no clear evidence about how these teachers use technology in their actual classrooms. In general, the way in which technology was utilized in teaching was limited and largely influenced by other factors, such as teachers' willingness to learn, students' participation, frequent interaction, and cooperation. This implies the need for future research to investigate the creative pedagogy of technology use in the classroom to contribute to improving classroom practices with regard to creativity and technology use.

Such a crisis highlights the importance of education technology, which has not been an influential part of Kuwait's education until the onset of COVID-19. Delays and interruptions of the academic year disrupted the lives of many students around the world, including Kuwait. Since e-learning technologies are not traditionally used in Kuwaiti higher education, this study aims to investigate the acceptance of technology and whether that has changed with the pandemic. It seeks to find useful strategies that could assist teachers in effectively using electronic distance-learning digital resources. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) has been developed to investigate the degrees of usage and acceptance of technology. This paper adopts an improved model that also includes the educational experience of teachers, in an attempt to understand the context of Kuwaiti higher education. Therefore, this quantitative study examines the use and acceptance of educational technologies of English language instructors in higher education. The study uses an online survey among 33 English language instructors at the Public Authority for Applied Education and Training (PAAET) to also account for the perceptions and experiences of the teachers.

       " \"Technology reviews are a specific article genre published in several language teaching and learning journals. Their emergence is likely due to the proliferation of technology that facilitates and supports language acquisition. These reviews aim to increase teachers' and learners' awareness of the forms of technology available and succinctly describe their benefits and limitations for language teaching and learning. As education enters a new digital age, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to determine which forms of technology support teachers' professional learning and how they can be utilized. This article presents a systematic review of technology reviews published between 2017 and 2022 in five Q1 SCOPUS-indexed language teaching and learning journals: &quot;RELC Journal,&quot; &quot;TESOL Journal,&quot; &quot;CALICO Journal,&quot; &quot;Language Learning and Technology&quot; and &quot;Teaching English as a Second Language Electronic Journal&quot; (TESL-EJ). These five journals were the only Q1 language teaching and learning journals we identified that publish technology reviews. All 73 technology reviews published in the 5-year period in the 5 journals were reviewed. Using professional digital competence as a framework, we explore what the articles reveal about how technology is used, as well as the knowledge gaps that remain. We examine the types and features of the technology described in the reviews, the language skills and educational levels of the learners, and the pedagogical implications of technology use. We found that the technology reviews mainly introduced the technological features and functions of the reviewed technologies with less emphasis placed on their pedagogical utilities and social aspects of their use for language teaching. The article concludes with recommendations for authors and journal editors regarding the content that should be included in a technology review to ensure that it is helpful to the profession. We also offer advice to practitioners on how to benefit from technology reviews.\",\n",

The study adds to the existing literature by testing the association between university English learners' intention to use technology to achieve personal and interpersonal English learning purposes, attitude towards technology, and perceived usefulness of technology. It examined predictive paths between intended and actual technology use by university learners. With reference to 539 returned questionnaires collected from four language and education disciplines in a private university in Hong Kong, the respondents showed a positive attitude and perceptions towards the use of technology for English language learning. However, their actual adoption of technology to achieve personal or interpersonal learning purposes was not commensurate with the two key learner factors and intention.

Precipitated by COVID-19, U.S. Intensive English Programs (IEPs) quickly transitioned from face-to-face (F2F) instruction to the emergency remote teaching environment (ERTE) when the public health crisis occurred. The purpose of this study was to identify how University and College Intensive English Program (UCIEP) instructors used technology, to explore their perceptions of factors that played a role in using technology, and to understand how they learned to use technology. Using purposeful sampling, 10 UCIEP instructors were interviewed using the general qualitative approach (Merriam &amp; Tisdell, 2016). The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) (Venkatesh et al., 2003) served as the theoretical framework for the study and guided the development of the interview protocol. The findings indicate the influence of the CLT approach on how the instructors used technology to facilitate activities. Instructors described how the facilitator role in CLT activities changed, and how they questioned translanguaging in the remote environment. During remote teaching instructors relied on Zoom features and used various technologies, collaborative tools, and video in synchronous and asynchronous environments. Their use of technologies was influenced by several factors, including their reported prior experience with educational technology, their ease in using technology, and input from their colleagues and students. Additional perceived factors that played a role in facilitating CLT activities in the ERTE included the usefulness of technology, their effectiveness in using technology, and barriers such as the lack of access to stable internet and adequate bandwidth. In regards to how instructors learned to use technology for facilitating CLT activities, they credited the education and technology resources provided by their IEP and university. Implications for teaching with technology and instructor development in IEP programs in the United States are provided.

Regardless of the high number of Vietnamese teachers working in this sector, how they perceive technology integration and how important it is to their professional development have not yet been thoroughly studied. Therefore, this study sought to provide evidence to understand Vietnamese teachers' perspectives toward technology in more detail and shed light on how to support them with technology training so that the training not only improves their teaching skills but also helps facilitate their professional development. The study employed a mixed-methods approach with classroom observations, semi-structured interviews, and a questionnaire survey. Data collected were analyzed by using thematic analysis and triangulated to ascertain the final findings. The results have shown that the language teachers in this study expressed enthusiasm toward technology regardless of the insufficient training and the challenges of technology self-education. Interview data also revealed the importance of a community of practice to the participants as it encouraged them to learn and overcome technology-related difficulties. The community in this study has also played a key role in the relationship between technology education and teachers' professional development in their workplace.

Data were collected in the form of a language background survey, parental interviews, and recordings of interactional events within the home. Findings suggest that parents use technology as a language management tool within the home domain to transmit their HL through enhancing HL language practices and creating rich HL linguistic environments, which both support and seem to contradict parents' declared language beliefs. Technology allows Family members from across the world to frequently partake in everyday multilingual talk thereby strengthening HL learning and use. Interestingly, the support parents feel technology offers them in transmitting the HL reduces their own anxiety over their children's HL development whilst also unexpectedly relaxing their attitudes towards fears of (over)consumption of technology. Equally, technology appears to support children to consciously develop overt bilingual identities that they previously did not (openly) profess. The data supports the notion of technology as semiotic practice emphasising that with strategic parental support and agency from children, technology can transform the home into a hub where the learning and maintenance of the HL is advocated in multiple unprecedented ways.\",\n",
       " 'Advances in technology are enabling dramatic changes in education content, delivery, and accessibility. Throughout history, new technologies have facilitated the exponential growth of human knowledge. In the early twentieth century, the focus was on the use of radios in education. But since then, innovators have seen technology as a way to improve communication, learning, and the mastery of instructional material. The next generation of education technologies is facilitating substantial change. Education technologies are evolving beyond lecture and group work to games, simulations, and augmented reality. Software is creating environments where students can direct the creation of their own knowledge with nearly invisible prompts from teachers. While there are many innovations in education technology, this report highlights five education technology success stories. Each has demonstrated the ability to improve efficiency and effectiveness in education systems. From language teaching robots to educational games, each has the potential to help students and teachers. The authors review these education success stories in order to offer lessons on how education stakeholders can better serve students and add value to their learning. (Contains 57 endnotes.)',\n",

It has also been argued that the integration of technology has been unsuccessful in Kuwait. This study aims to explore the factors influencing teachers' use of technology in English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom in Kuwaiti government primary schools. More specifically, it aims to highlight factors promoting and hindering EFL teachers' use of technology. For the purpose of this study, 55 questionnaire responses were collected from different primary school teachers in Kuwait, followed up with 15 semi-structured interviews. The study findings show that Kuwaiti primary school EFL teachers who participated in the current study demonstrated positive attitudes towards using technology and acknowledged the implementation of some cutting-edge technologies in their classrooms. Enhancing students' language learning, innovation and school support were the main factors that encouraged the participating teachers to use technology. Other factors hindered the use of technology; particularly those related to lack of parental support, personal expenses and health problems, teachers' lack of skills and training, poor classroom infrastructure, and time constraints/workload. The findings also reveal that the lack of professional development training workshops provided by the Ministry of Education led the Kuwaiti teachers to rely more on informal training in which they worked and learnt together with their colleagues in small sub-groups to improve their use of technology. The study findings have implications for policymakers and other stakeholders intending to integrate technology in Kuwaiti primary schools.\",\n",

While children get acquainted with the digital technology before the age of six, teachers, who have encountered with the digital world at a later time in their lives, struggle with it. Self-directed learning, which is crucial for lifelong learning, can be enhanced by the use technology particularly beyond the classroom settings. The aim of this study was to examine the difference between the perceptions of 5-8 graders in low and high income groups about their technology use skills and their English teachers' technology use skills. It also tested the correlation between their perceptions of their self-directed language learning behaviors and their technology use skills as well as their English teachers' technology use skills. The population of the study consisted of 145 students. Inter group comparisons and correlational research methods were adopted. The results indicated that the low and high income students' perceptions did not differ regarding their own technology use skills, and similarly their English teachers' technology use skills. There was no correlation between the perceptions of the low/high income group combination regarding their technology use skills and their English teachers' technology use skills. And lastly, their perceptions on their self-directed learning behaviors did not correlate with their perceptions on their technology use skills and their English teachers' technology use skills. The educational implications of these results were discussed and suggestions were put forward so as to produce more effective learning environments.\",\n",

Technology integration into language courses naturally requires new qualifications for English language teachers. Because, the use of technology has been affecting and changing the way English is taught and students learn. Therefore, technological competence levels of English teachers should be improved. In this context, it is essential to equip English teachers with the necessary technological knowledge and skills before they become real teachers.

       " 'Drawing on survey data, this paper examines the patterns and perceptions of technology use by primary EFL teachers in China. Findings suggest that although Chinese EFL teachers hold positive attitudes toward the value of technology for teaching and learning, they use technology mainly for teacher-centered purposes, such as teaching preparation and instructional delivery, and seldom utilize technology for student-centered activities. Factors constraining student-oriented technological use in early EFL instruction include teacher-center pedagogical practices and lack of effective professional development that focuses on instructional design and technology integration. These findings suggest that China must redirect its effort to promote teacher conceptual and pedagogical change in integrating technology in early EFL instruction and emphasize alignment among technology, curriculum, and pedagogy in EFL teaching.

For this reason, there have been several proposals which seek to anchor CALL research within various existing theoretical frameworks--for instance, instructed second language acquisition and sociocultural theory. This article aims at contributing to the theoretical and methodological development of CALL research by throwing light on the potential benefits of using a particular conceptual framework--that of a critical theory of technology, which stresses the necessity of contextualizing technology and understanding its social embeddeness when investigating its integration in any context.

A cross case analysis of four teachers was undertaken to examine these teachers' actions, beliefs, and the contexts they teach in so as to illuminate issues related to the implementation of computers for instructional purposes. Methods from the grounded theory research tradition were employed in the analysis of qualitative data. In terms of beliefs, results indicate that teachers consider technology to have a dehumanizing impact on ELL teaching and learning. They also consider that technology is useful for efficient classroom management. Further, while teachers believe that technology motivates students, it can also be distracting to students and encourage off-task behavior. They also believe that technology implementation requires more time than it is worth. In terms of actions, results indicate that teachers resist a sense of disempowerment that results from top down punitive evaluations through passive aggressive actions such as cutting corners and cosmetic compliance. However, they also ask for more technology training to ameliorate their technophobia. In terms of context, this study revealed that when technology is used, teacher centeredness and control remains. Technology does not essentially change instructional style or classroom culture. Also, the top down Ministry of Education evaluation punishes schools that fail to meet evaluative standards by furnishing them fewer resources. This results in the schools' increased vulnerability. Teachers perceive this misaligned evaluative measure as punishing them and their schools unfairly thus having a damaging impact on morale and appropriate technology implementation.

It would seem unimaginable for young adults today to communicate or exchange ideas without using technology. The plethora of devices competing with the computer, from smartphones to tablets, just to name a few, have provided students with the ability to communicate and get information with unprecedented accessibility and speed. Because visual culture, youth culture, and digital media go hand in hand today, it is only logical that classrooms move beyond the traditional methods of teaching, which no longer seem compatible with student expectations or the needs of today's workforce, and utilize this passion for technology.

Therefore, the present cross-cultural case study was conducted to compare and contrast the patterns of using technology in two Asian universities, one in Japan (a technologically advanced country) and another in Iran (a technologically advancing country). The participants were 248 Japanese and 235 Iranian students. The data were collected through an online questionnaire that gained information about students' use of technology in everyday life in their L1 (Japanese &amp; Persian) and in L2 (English), students' use of discipline-specific technology in English, and their attitudes toward the use of technology for language learning. The findings revealed that there is not a very significant difference between the patterns of using technology in Japan and Iran in both L1 and L2. The major difference was that the Japanese tended to use more information technologies in L1, while the Iranians leaned toward communication technologies. It was also found that Iranian students used technology in L2 more than the Japanese, especially in terms of communication technologies.\",\n",

       " \"From a learner-as-creator perspective, this study investigates how second language learners use technology, especially computers and the Internet, to construct their language learning environments. This study also attempts to identify factors that affected the frequency of technology by second language learners. Participants were 102 Chinese university freshmen who had been learning English as a second language.    Results suggest that in spite of the great potentials of technology in constructing an optimal language learning environment, technology use was not optimal when learners created their own language environments. Second language learners used technology mainly to get language input. Technology was hardly used for opportunities for language use or receiving feedback. Social factors such as the average English proficiency of all the peers in the learner's social network were found to be associated with both the frequency of technology use in second language learning and whether or not a learner used technology to learn English with a certain peer.    Results of this study have both theoretical and practical implications. Results from this study shed light on the gap between the potentials and affordances of technology in second language learning as claimed by a large body of literature and the reality of implementation by learners. The findings of the study indicate the great need to focus more on how learners use technology in their own learning.

       " 'There is much research in the scholarly literature about using technology to support language learning, and particularly English as a Foreign Language, but the technology is rarely integrated into the curriculum, largely because the research is the product of the pressure on faculty to publish. The author explores curriculum integration, based on Dörnyei (2014) who called for CALL educational programs to employ holistic instructional designs that are based on long-term instructional outcome goals; Colpaert (2012) who suggested that rather than studying the &quot;differences&quot; that result from the use or non-use of a particular technology, researchers should better work to understand the &quot;affordances&quot; provided by the technology to understand the ability that the technology provides to enhance an overall instructional design; and Kennedy and Levy (2009) who spoke disparagingly of what they called &quot;one-off&quot; projects that do not stand the test of time and advocated that technology choices should be long-term projects as opposed to short-term tests, hence the term sustainable design. The author concludes that EFL scholars need a new perspective in which student outcomes are the most important criteria in choosing technology, and that in order to broadly understand the affordances provided by various kind of technology, extensive meta-analysis of past studies is urgently needed. The corollary to this need is that a scholarly culture is needed in which reporting failure is just as important as reporting success because in this way, we help others to learn from the problems arising in our own studies so that they can improve their own research designs and NOT repeat designs that performed inadequately. Conclusions and recommendations are provided.

It reveals that research effort in these educational sectors has increased in line with technological developments and there have been important differences between the primary and secondary sectors in the adoption of applications. There then follows an in-depth review of 47 post-2000 studies investigating the efficacy of technology in the teaching of L2 English. It asks what technology has been used and why, what evidence there is that technology facilitates language learning, and what other insights can be drawn from the research in this field. The evidence that technology has a direct beneficial impact on linguistic outcomes is slight and inconclusive, but it may impact indirectly and positively on learner attitudes and behaviours and may promote collaboration. On the whole, the research reviewed lacked the quality that would reassure practitioners and policy-makers that technological investment is warranted. We argue that future research needs to provide a tighter link between technological applications, Second Language Acquisition (SLA) theory, and learning outcomes.',\n",

Six instructors from one intensive English program participated in interviews and observations. Key personnel and students provided additional information on instructors' integration of technology through interviews and a questionnaire, respectively. Results of the study show that instructors' definitions of technology influenced the way they integrated technology into their language courses. Instructors' perceived technology as being beneficial to their teaching practices with all of the instructors having been observed integrating technology into their courses in some way. Findings indicated instructors' espousal and enactment of technology integration in general were in alignment with their definitions of technology and their integration of technology. However, one key difference was noted. While instructors espoused student-centered teaching philosophies, discussing how technology integration could facilitate such philosophies, most instructors' integration of technology was more aligned with teacher-centered practices. Future studies should consider examining further instructors' espousal and enactment of technology integration with regard to their teaching philosophies. The current study examined instructors in only one intensive English program. In order to better understand instructor espousal and enactment of technology integration in the English as a second language classroom, future research should explore this research in other English as a second/ foreign language contexts.

If the aim is to prepare prospective teachers to effectively, efficiently, and engagingly use technologies in changing professional circumstances, it is important to provide learning tasks that are not only authentic and meaningful, but also strengthen computer self-efficacy. Technology-enabled PBL with the assistance of process prompts was used to elicit prospective teachers' perceptions of their learning experiences in past courses in the program to help them integrate knowledge acquired prior to solving instructional problems and to assist them in self-assessing their own knowledge. Thirty-five prospective teachers enrolled in a Web-Based Instruction for English Language Teaching (ELT) course worked collaboratively for a duration of four months in groups of five to complete a project. Collected data included surveys, interviews, final projects, and reflections. Students' interviews and reflections revealed that process prompts were important in facilitating problem-solving efforts; they support metacognitive thinking, and facilitate the construction of knowledge in technology-enabled PBL. The surveys showed significant gains on students' computer self-efficacy after the completion of technology-enabled PBL. The findings contribute to the field of technology education through PBL and provide a point of reference for other teachers who want to implement PBL in their curricula. The implications of the approach for the use of technology-enabled PBL for teacher education are discussed. (Contains 5 tables.)\",\n",

       " \"The teaching of English to non-native English Young Learners requires more attempts rather than teaching learners in older ages. Nowadays, technology has offered many benefits for EYL teachers. Technology, in one side, is helpful instrument for the teachers in dealing with EYL. In the other side, easiness offered by technology may bring consequences on the EYL teachers' creative competence. EFL university students in the world are now habituated with technology-based teaching and learning media. They are demanded to improve the skill to use those media and due to the demand, their creativity in developing method and technique to teach EYL without technology aids is in a serious jeopardy. At least, they will deal with classic difficulty in teaching EYL for example by using only a written story; the difficulty meant is lacking of idea. This research was accomplished to investigate it. By employing written submission, data from eight last year EFL University students revealed their ideas on using story in teaching EYL is under expectation. By employing descriptive interpretation on their written submission, it is indicated that their ideas are heavily tailored to use technology aids.\",\n",
       " \"Despite a consensus that technologies facilitate English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teaching, Chinese EFL teachers are not using technologies at the optimal level of expectation. To address the problem of ineffective technology use, this study purports to delineate the interactions among three teacher internal variables (i.e., Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), affective and evaluative attitudes towards technology) and two technology usage variables (i.e., technology use for face-to-face and online instruction). Data were collected from 261 EFL teachers at 17 universities in China via a self-reported questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results revealed that teachers' TPACK, which related to their evaluative attitudes, positively influenced their actual technology use for both face-to-face and entire online instruction. Their evaluative attitudes also positively affected technology use for face-to-face instruction. In contrast, affective attitudes influenced neither type of technology use. The main theoretical values of this study were conceptualizing technology usage as a dichotomous variable to better fit the blended learning context and introducing a new dyadic perspective on attitudes towards technology. It also provided practical implications for computer-assist language learning policymakers and EFL faculty professional development in China.\",\n",
       " \"Recognizing how essential communication technologies have become to language learners, the TESOL Technology Standards Task Force set three goals for learners (Healey et al., 2011): 1) demonstrating skills in technology for a multilingual world, 2) using technology appropriately and ethically, and 3) using and evaluating technology for language learning. Nevertheless, despite the fact that social networking sites (SNSs), such as Facebook (FB), are perhaps the most frequently used communication technology, few, if any, studies have specified effective SNS L2 use as a learning objective. This paper aims to show how training L2 learners to use FB effectively can potentially help learners reach the three goals set by the Technology Standards Task Force.

The current study adopted the UTAUT model to explore the acceptance of digital technology in English learning by college students in mainland China and adopted the CET4 and CET6 score to demonstrate Chinese college students' English learning performance. Structural Equation Modeling was used in the current research. This research found that Perceived Usefulness and Social Norms predict students' technology use intention. Students' use intentions and Teachers' Technology Use significantly impact students technology use. Teachers' technology use positively correlates with students' English proficiency score in CET4 and CET6. Students autonomous technology use positively correlates students' English proficiency score in CET6.

       " \"Integrating technology into the foreign language classroom has introduced challenging demands for prospective teachers in designing technology-enhanced lessons. Thus, careful guidance is required to help pre-service teachers identify, integrate, and reflect on appropriate technologies to create more learning opportunities. The present study aims to guide pre-service teachers in incorporating technology into their situated teaching practices during a 12-week practicum experience via a step-by-step training procedure. It explores both their own ideas and those of students about technology-enhanced lessons. For this purpose, eight pre-service teachers and 95 students in an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context in Turkey participated in the study. Qualitative analyses of diaries and focus group interviews revealed that prospective teachers and their students had positive attitudes towards integrating technology into a second language and/or foreign language (L2) class albeit a few concerns and problems were raised. Technology-enhanced classes promoted language skills, contributed to creating a favorable and motivating learning atmosphere, fostered active participation, and helped pre-service teachers tailor their lessons to their students' needs and interests. By offering a situated learning opportunity to incorporate technology into L2 classes blended with reflective practice, findings of the study may illuminate future practices for successful technology integration in language teaching.\",\n",

       " \"There is a wealth of research investigating language learners' adoption of digital technology in higher education. To date, however, research primarily focuses on the implementation of technology in formal learning either inside or outside of the classroom, and the associations between factors influencing learners' informal English learning in online contexts are not adequately discussed. Therefore, the present study aims to identify and test the main factors related to students' informal online English learning (IOEL) that could predict their usage intention. To better understand the drivers of technology use for informal L2 learning among university students, this study proposed a model based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to investigate students' behavioural intention toward IOEL with particular reference to Malaysian L2 learners. The partial least square approach of the structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was applied to test the proposed research model and the corresponding hypotheses. The results indicate that nine out of ten of the hypotheses were supported, which implies that the extended model can effectively predict L2 learners' IOEL technology adoption in online contexts. The results also showed that perceived interaction and perceived ease of use were the two main predictors influencing learner's technology acceptance for IOEL.\",\n",

       " \"Very little is known about how teachers' &quot;conceptualizations&quot; of digital technology and their &quot;uses&quot; of the technology evolve and relate. Yet knowing about and understanding teachers' conceptions and uses of digital technology are essential for learning how teachers integrate it effectively for student learning. By applying sociocognitive and sociocultural (i.e., the New Literacies Studies approach) perspectives to the study of digital technology use in classrooms, this study examine the conceptions about and uses of digital technology in English writing instruction among three teachers in Malaysia. Three questions framed the study: (1) How do Malaysian teachers &quot;conceptualize&quot; digital technology and its use in English writing instruction? (2) How do Malaysian teachers use digital technology in English writing instruction? (3) How do Malaysian teachers' conceptualizations of digital technology &quot;relate&quot; to and &quot;affect&quot; their use of digital technology in English writing instruction? Working within the tradition of descriptive and exploratory qualitative research, this study employed a multiple case study approach. Three teachers from suburban/rural secondary schools in an economically-underdeveloped state in Malaysia were participants. The teachers were surveyed, interviewed, and observed about their conceptualizations and uses of digital technology in English writing instruction. Artifacts from their English writing instruction were collected, analyzed, and triangulated with the survey, interview, and observational data. The data were analyzed using within-case analysis, cross-case analysis, narrative discourse analysis, and constant-comparative analysis. Results of the study indicate that while digital technology was found to be helpful and convenient, teachers reported contested conceptions of and ongoing concerns about the use of digital technology and its effectiveness in English writing instruction. In all, the teachers were balancing their contested conceptions of digital technology in order to use fully the advantages (i.e., affordances) and minimize the disadvantages (i.e., constraints) of digital technology in their English instruction. These contested conceptions were not only central to their psychological aspects, such as their personal values on and experiences with digital technology, but also the social and contextual aspects, such as their students' high proficiency with digital technology tools' (and their misuse of them) and the schools' access to or restraints from digital technology tools and support. These psychological and social contexts created a web of conundrums made of strings of affordances and constraints, access and restraints, and dual identities as digital natives and digital immigrants that the teachers had to consider carefully in their uses of digital technology in their English writing instruction. These contested visions offer great significance to Malaysian education, especially with the role of the English language and with digital technology as a culture and important mediating tools for education. As I discuss about these contested visions in the Malaysian education in general, and in English writing instruction in particular, I also discuss the efforts that should be put forth in enhancing their advantages and in limiting their disadvantages. In doing so, I provide suggestions for the social implications of digital technology and English/literacy instruction; implications for the educational system and its policies; implications for instructional pedagogy; implications for future research; and implications for research methodology.

       " \"This study used the technology acceptance model to examine the influence of individually espoused cultural values on teachers' intentions to use technology in Chinese universities. To address the limitations of model parsimony, the lack of studies in developing countries and the cultural biases in the technology acceptance literature, this study was conducted in a developing country -- China. It extended the constructs of subjective norms and facilitating conditions into the technology acceptance model and investigated the influence of individually espoused cultural values on technology acceptance. The four cultural value dimensions, including masculinity versus femininity, individualism versus collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term versus short-term orientation, were measured at the individual level, as technology acceptance was considered an individual concern. To test the hypothesised model, data from 502 teachers in Chinese universities were analysed using structural equation modelling. The results revealed that technology acceptance model was a valid framework for explaining Chinese teachers' technology acceptance. Perceived usefulness, subjective norms, attitudes towards use and culture were all significant determinants of behavioural intentions, with attitudes towards use having the largest effect. This study demonstrated the significant influence of subjective norms on perceived usefulness. Specifically, it showed that they facilitated the influence of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness on attitudes toward use.\",\n",
       " \"Technologies have the potential to support language teaching and learning, but English as a Second Language (ESL) teachers in the United States (U.S.) either sparingly use technologies for instruction or use them at low level. Although previous research has indicated some promises and challenges faced by U.S. ESL teachers with integrating technology in their ESL classrooms, those promises and challenges are incomplete and thus only partially reveal what actually support and what inhibit their technology integration. To solve this problem, the purpose of this paper is to critically analyze the promises, as well as the challenges, for ESL teachers to integrate technology in the U.S. K-12 classroom. Based on research about technology-enhanced ESL instruction, Kim, Hannafin, and Bryan's (2007) pedagogical framework for technology integration was adapted to the ESL context. Grounded in the modified framework, the promises and challenges associated with ESL teachers' use of technology were discussed within each of the three interrelated contexts: (a) the macrocontext (systemic reform and educational standards); (b) teacher community and professional development; (c) the microcontext (technology-supported ESL class). Future research directions within each context were also suggested.\",\n",
       " \"This research study examines teaching beliefs of English-language professors in Japan, how professors make sense of their beliefs, and how the beliefs influence their pedagogical strategies related to using technology and teaching with technology. An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) research design was used. Six English-language professors employed full-time in universities in Tokyo and Kanagawa participated in this study. Social Cognitive Theory was used as the theoretical framework. Each instructor's beliefs interacted in a complex manner within the higher education system in Japan, which impacted instructors' actual teaching practices related to the use of technology. This study demonstrated that instructors' beliefs about teaching are intrinsically related to their incorporation of technology as well as to the frequency of their use of technology. It revealed a complicated relationship between what teachers think and what they do in class in relation to technology-mediated tasks. Findings of this study suggest that English Language Teaching (ELT) instructors at the university level in Japan are navigating through a complex cultural, Confucian-influenced, structural educational system. Computer-mediated instruction includes Computer-assisted language learning (CALL), information and communications technology (ICT), social networking service (SNS), e-learning, and m-learning. This study suggests technology integration into the English language curriculum will require a greater collaborative effort by stakeholders in recognizing instructors' beliefs as vital to technology acceptance.

In the context of English as a foreign language, this study investigates how Chinese students produce an English video with over-the-counter technology tools for accomplishing a language-learning task. In particular, this study probes into how youngsters today respond to a given learning task, how and why they adopt technology tools available and of use to them for the task. Data collection is through observation, students' reports, and interviews. The focus on specific case study settings offers a closer look at how the use of technology tools is socially and technologically shaped in each individual case. Students reported that they welcomed and valued such learning experience and had in general positive attitude toward the tools and their use in learning. The results reveal students' willingness and capability in adopting technology tools, whether familiar or unfamiliar to them, and appropriating these tools to fulfill their individual leaning needs. Implications have been drawn to provide a new aspect of technology adoption in school learning.\",\n",

The main instruments applied were teachers' and students' surveys and observation sheets. One hundred and fifty students and fifteen teachers took part in the surveys and were observed once a week during a period of four months. The findings confirm that technology is not commonly used in state schools of the south region of Ecuador or, if used, it is not adequately applied.

To examine this, they were interviewed, asked to perform a task that involved reading online, required to make a Glogster (an online interactive poster) about their reading, and were videotaped in the process. They were subsequently asked if they found the activity motivating, and if their teachers had used Glogsters, video, or other technology-based reading incentives in the past.

       " \"Aim/Purpose: The purpose of this study was to survey student opinions about technology in order to best implement and utilize technology in the classroom. In this paper, technology refers to 'digital technology'. The aims of this study were to: (1) examine student attitudes towards technology in regards to enjoyment and perceived usefulness; (2) investigate what tools and devices students enjoyed and preferred to use for learning; (3) examine whether students preferred learning with books and paper instead of technological devices (e.g. laptops, tablets, smartphones); and (4) investigate whether student opinions about digital technology and preferred learning tools differ between two universities (based on their level of technology implementation) and between two programs (Foundation Studies and General Studies). Background: Previous studies have investigated student device choice, however, fewer studies have looked specifically at which tools and devices students choose for certain academic tasks, and how these preferences may vary according to the level of digital technology integration between two different universities. Methodology: In this study, a mix of quantitative and qualitative data was gathered from 1102 participants across two universities in the United Arab Emirates from an English-language Foundation Studies program and a first-year General Studies program. A questionnaire (containing closed-ended and open-ended questions) was followed by three focus-group interviews (n=4,3,2). ANOVA and t-Tests were used to test for statistically significant differences in the survey data, and qualitative survey and interview data were analyzed for recurring themes. Contribution: This study aims to provide a more comprehensive account of the learning tools (including books/paper, laptops, tablets, and phones) students prefer to use to complete specific academic tasks within a university context. This study also seeks to evaluate student attitudes towards using digital technology for learning, in order to best implement and utilize technology in the context of higher education institutions in the Middle East and around the world. Findings: Findings suggest that participants enjoy learning how to use new technology, believe it improves learning, and prepares them for future jobs. Books/paper were the most preferred resources for learning, followed closely by laptops, while tablets and smartphones were much less preferred for specific educational tasks. The data also revealed that respondents preferred learning through a combination of traditional resources (e.g. books, paper) and digital technological tools (e.g. laptops, tablets). Recommendations for Practitioners: These findings can be used to recommend to educators and higher education administrators the importance of adopting learning outcomes related to digital literacy in the classroom, to not only help students become more effective learners, but also more skilled professionals in their working lives. Additionally, classroom practices that incorporate both traditional tools and newer technological tools for learning might be most effective because they provide flexibility to find the best learning tool(s) for the task. Recommendation for Researchers: Participants preferred books and paper for learning. One reason was that paper helped them remember information better. More research needs to be done on the learning benefits of using more tactile mediums, such as paper for reading and writing. Impact on Society: The findings from this study suggest that some learners may benefit more from the use of digital technology than others. Institutions and organizations need to provide flexibility when it comes to technology implementation for both students and faculty. This flexibility can accommodate different learning styles and preferences and not isolate individuals in the classroom or workplace who may be slower to adapt to new technologies. Future Research: Future research is needed to investigate student attitudes towards digital technology at higher education institutions in other parts of the world. In addition, this study focused mostly on student perceptions of learning tools and devices in the classroom. More research needs to be done on the impact technology has on learning per se -- specifically how certain tools may help learners more effectively complete different educational tasks.\",\n",

We focus on the type of needs and their order of priority from the viewpoint of English as a Second/Foreign Language (ESL/EFL) teachers and suggest some recommendations for training programs. These data, collected via an online questionnaire distributed in several countries, were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively in relation to participants' perceptions of needs regarding language education technology, as well as participants' perceptions of the &quot;ideal&quot; teacher, and their relation to the use of technology. Results indicate that despite overall satisfaction regarding training received, many teachers mention their need for a posttraining follow-up. They also express interest in developing &quot;learning task design&quot; skills and in exploring course management platforms such as Moodle. Furthermore, while most participants fully or partially agree with the relationship between technology and excellence in language teaching, their definition of the &quot;ideal&quot; language teacher rarely includes the use of technology. A shift in &quot;ideal&quot; teacher beliefs seems, therefore, necessary for better adoption and use of technology in language education.\",\n",

Researchers also indicate a need to better understand the knowledge-base of language teacher education (LTE), including a teacher's possible 40 year career through ever changing technology. This mixed-method case study examines the use of iPads by four teachers, who represent maximum variation in their teaching and technology experience, in two mostly homogenous schools. The study looks specifically at how teachers' perceptions of 1) teaching, 2) technology, 3) using technology and 4) their students shape the way they use iPads with English language learners. It also examines what supports facilitate the use of iPads for instructional purposes in second language classrooms. I focus on the use of iPads in a one-to-one implementation in a technologically embedded context because iPads are a relatively new innovation in classrooms, with the potential of changing instruction. Such changes may contribute to the challenges and benefits of being an effective teacher in the English language teaching (ELT) classroom. Research on the use of iPads in classrooms has been previously limited to mostly suggestions for use and has given little guidance in how this disruption will assist and challenge teachers. TPACK is used as a powerful construct based in a reconceptualization of the language teacher education (LTE) knowledge-base, indicating influences of context, teachers and their perceptions, identity and agency and activities in the classroom. These factors suggest ways which classroom technology and teacher, student, administrative and contextual influences may mediate the activities of teaching and learning in the classroom. The data show a correlation between teachers' practices with iPads and their previous experiences using technology in the classroom. Teacher groupings demonstrated differences in teaching based on their experience using technology and teaching. Schools showed differences only in terms of some choices made by the administration. Students' effects on the use of iPads is minimal, except for instances of how student behavior affected the classroom.

       " 'In program year 2006-2007, 46 percent of the adults enrolled in federally funded, state-administered adult education programs in the United States were enrolled in English as a Second Language (ESL) programs. These adult English language learners represent a wide range of ages, nationalities, native languages, and English proficiency levels. In order to learn the language, content, and skills needed to be successful in U.S. society and the workforce, these adults need time to devote to learning. However, time spent in formal programs is often limited. Integrating technology in instruction for adult English language learners may offer the flexibility to extend learning beyond that available in a formal program and thus increase opportunities for language and literacy learning. Technology also offers access to new, dynamic opportunities for interaction among students and between teachers and students. The use of technology with adults learning English can also reduce the digital divide by helping these students develop a basic understanding of computers and technology. Additionally, there is evidence that the use of technology with adult English language learners may facilitate their progress toward proficiency in English. This brief discusses three ways of using technology with adults learning English (onsite, blended, and online) and describes examples of some specific technologies and programs for adults learning English. Teachers using technology need to continue to provide opportunities for in-person interaction to promote language and literacy development. Further research is needed on the impact of different uses of technology and on uses that promote English acquisition over time. Given the rapid rate of innovations in software and Internet access, long-term research studies are needed to understand more about the role and impact of using technology with adults learning English.',\n",

As a first step in the study, prospective English teachers' general attitudes towards technology were assessed. The results indicated that prospective English teachers had positive attitudes towards technology and technology use in lessons. As a next step, an ANOVA test was used to compare participants from different grade levels in terms of their attitudes towards technology use. The results indicated that first grade prospective English teachers have relatively lower levels of positive attitudes towards technology. Then, the model fit indices were calculated and the scale was subjected to factor analysis. As a result, the model that was constructed within the scope of the study was found to be perfect based on the results of a number of fit test indices and reasonable based on few fit test indices.

It succinctly chronicles a series of common technological tools, applications, and approaches, starting from the excitement offered by CALL which predated MALL and its associated allies. It shows how ELT has shaped up under the auspices of modern information and communication technology (ICT) which has driven a transformation from traditional teacher-centered and text-bound classrooms into student-centered and interactive paradigms. The paper argues that despite this refinement, technology per se is not a recipe for success in learning and teaching English as a foreign or second language (L2). Technology integration into L2 pedagogy relatively lacks a solid theoretical framework; it requires reconciliation between theory and practice which is an ongoing debate.

The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model was performed to measure students' acceptance of the use of technology in this study. The findings of this study indicated that the four aspects mentioned above, such as Performance Expectations, Effort Expectations, Social Influences, and Facilitation Conditions, have a favorable impact on students' Behavioral intentions when using technology to learn English Pharmacy. However, only 40% of the four factors could explain the influence on Behavioral intention. The impact of this study is that it can lead the way and serve as a reference for future research on the UTAUT approach in larger scope. In addition, the university should be able to increase the benefits and usability of technology as a learning resource by developing its own Learning Management System (LMS) which is easy to use.\",\n",
       " \"As India aspires to become the information and communication technology (ICT) leader in the world, the education of its children is a primary concern. While India's policymakers expect ICT to usher in promising education changes, there is a limited understanding of how computers are used and negotiated in India's schools. This dissertation is an ethnographic study of the meanings and uses for computer technology in elementary schools settings in Bangalore, India. The dissertation's purpose is to describe and report on how computer technology is socially constructed in Bangalore's fifth grade classrooms. Using case study research design, the dissertation investigates and compares the social shaping of computer technology in a socioeconomic cross-section of four elementary schools. The dissertation's research questions and methodological approach are framed by the Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) theory. SCOT maintains that social groups, like students and teachers, construct the meanings and purposes for technology based on their social context and interactions. In schools, the social shaping of technology happens in a context of use and negotiation among students and teachers. The dissertation's data are comprised of field notes from extensive field observations, student and teacher questionnaires, teacher interviews, student focus group interviews, and artifacts, like digital pictures, of each elementary school setting. How computer technology is socially constructed in Bangalore's elementary schools is a complex phenomenon. The dissertation thickly describes and offers various interpretations to clarify this complexity. This study illustrates how students and teachers assign meanings to computer technology in relationship to the school's curriculum and pedagogical practices. The dissertation also examines how the diverse meanings for computer technology relate to contextual factors like the school's mission statement and the predominant socio-economic status (SES) of the student body. At the dissertation's two lower SES schools, both of which were located in villages, the students used the school's computer technology primarily to practice and learn English. Both school's teachers and students interpreted that computer technology was empowering and provided the opportunity for a better life. At the dissertation's middle SES school, the students used the school's computer technology as part of a scripted computer science curriculum based on coding skills. Additionally, the computer science teachers at this school stated that the computer's primary purpose was for the development of logic skills needed for programming and engineering software. At the dissertation's upper SES school, the students used the school's computer technology to develop their research and presentation skills. At this school, the teachers and students agreed that the computer's most important purpose was to foster original thinking and the ownership of ideas. The dissertation concludes that accessory social groups, like non-governmental organizations and the school administrators, have significant influence in stabilizing the meanings assigned to technology. The dissertation's findings enhance the understandings of the way that social groups, in Bangalore's elementary schools, use and assign meaning to computer technology.

       " 'Learning to write well can be a significant contributor to English language proficiency. The large population of English language learners (ELLs) has highlighted the need for educational technology as an important support for the different approaches to writing instruction for ELLs. In this meta-analysis, we examined the effectiveness of educational technology applications on the writing quality of adult ELLs. Twenty-one independent studies from 16 publications were included in this review. Our findings confirmed that technology applications produce a large effect size (0.93 and 1.28, fixed effect model and random effect model respectively) as compared to non-technology instructional methods. We conducted sub-group analyses with six substantive and methodological factors: type of technology, genre of writing, program duration, program intensity, measures outcome, and research design, and followed the analyses with research and pedagogical implications.',\n",

Ten specific ways to assure constructivist technology use in teacher education are highlighted. These techniques have been synthesized into a compact model with three pillars: (a) electronic assessment system (e-portfolios for individual assessment and program evaluation), (b) teacher candidates' technology-based course assignments and performances, and (c) Web-based instruction and communication. The authors claim that within this three-pronged model flexibility of implementation is key to success for preservice and in-service teachers.\",\n",

However, the disparity between the dearth of technology integration in tertiary English education in Korea and its central position in Korean society cannot be overstated. As found in one of the most recent studies by Webster (2011) on teachers' perceptions and uses of technology, teachers often lack motivation to make changes owing to a lack of reliable resources, training and professional development support. This article, therefore, provides the underpinning for a new theoretical approach to promoting a more culturally holistic engagement with technology at Korean universities and education in general.\",\n",

Educational technology has become an indispensable part of teaching-learning. Technologies for Language Learning and Teaching (TLLT) can provide language learners with exposure to authentic and intelligible language usage. EL teachers, consequently, need to have a good command over TLLT and their effective use. Following a multiple case study approach data were collected from ten EL teachers of five SS through classroom observations, face-to-face interviews, and a structured questionnaire. The findings showed that most teachers had basic technology skills but they made ineffective pedagogic use of technology. They need to use technology more often in classroom and develop pedagogical understanding of technology use for teaching English.\",\n",

Therefore, the author of this paper aimed to explore the role and impact of technology on students reading. To do so, the author has examined several aspects related to the use of technology for teaching and learning, including how technology can promote independent learning, communication, collaboration, assist students with learning needs, and certain limits of technology, before conducting research using interviews and observations with 86 participants (students, teachers, and parents). The research focused particularly on what role technologies such as text-to-speech apps, translators, electronic dictionaries, online reading apps and websites, etc., can play on students' reading, how they can impact students reading, and how they are perceived by students, teachers, and parents. At the end, the author provides some suggestions to consider for an effective use of these technologies.\",\n",
       " \"In meeting the needs of the new generation of learners, the idea of implementing the use of new technology such as Augmented Reality (AR) in English as a Second Language (ESL) classrooms can be a step toward in refining the teaching and learning atmosphere. Nevertheless, the use of this technology relies heavily on the teacher's level of acceptance and skills for it to be successful in classrooms. TESL Programme is one of the popular programmes in higher education institutions. In line with the advancement of technology in education and current transformation happening at schools, it is essential for the TESL curriculum at higher education institutions be revised according to the current training needs of the in-service teachers. Thus, this study intended to determine the English language teachers' perceptions towards the use of AR by applying the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the base of the research model. A survey was conducted on 180 English teachers from 20 schools in the district of Petaling Perdana. The items in the questionnaire elicited information on the levels of AR acceptance of the respondents based on the four variables of TAM, that are perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEoU), attitude towards use (ATT) and behavioural intention (BI) to use AR in ESL classroom. Findings indicate that the levels of AR acceptance of the English teachers are relatively high, as the respondents recorded a high level of PU, ATT and BI towards the use of AR while PEoU was at moderate level. The results from multiple regression analysis indicate that PU and ATT of the English teachers directly influence their BI to use AR in ESL classroom. The findings suggest that English teachers are acceptive and ready for the implementation of AR technology. These finding provide the much needed information for the TESL curriculum review in ensuring the higher education institutions provide programmes fulfil the demand of the technology transformation taking place at schools. Several implications derived from the salient findings were presented for curriculum developers and TESL instructors to consider in revising the curriculum and programme delivery strategies.\",\n",

       " \"Research in instructional technology offers valuable insights into how technology has been adopted in language teaching to improve student learning outcomes. However, this research is typically limited to affordances and constraints of different technological tools with little examination of teacher knowledge of integrating these tools and how macrostructures shape teacher practices in a language classroom. This paper fills the gap in literature by drawing on the Bourdieusian concept of habitus to provide a critical theoretical basis for designing technology-oriented professional development. It provides new ways to contextualize technology integration and teacher knowledge by introducing a framework to harness the power of technologies, including multimedia and hypermedia technological tools, in English language teaching and learning. The key findings of literature review demonstrate that teachers' practices can be explained by their habitus (which includes what teachers unconsciously know about teaching) and teaching-related schema generated from habitus. Also, pedagogical and technological practices are shaped by social contexts and major paradigm shifts in education. The findings suggest a need for designing technology-oriented professional development that considers teachers' backgrounds or habitus as well as their technological and pedagogical capital.\",\n",

       " 'The technology of flipped classroom technology approach implies such organization of the educational process in which classroom activities and homework assignments are reversed. Nowadays, the flipped classroom technology approach is altering how we collect information, conduct research, and share data with others in the Thai educational system. New technological tools are changing the education community and how the instructors pass on knowledge to learners. With this new tool, the flipped classroom technology approach is being integrated into the classroom at larger scales in most educational levels, especially in Thailand. With more electronic resources available for instructors, new teaching methodologies are being used to improve both EFL and ESL learners. The aims of this academic paper are to acknowledge the significance of applying the flipped classroom technology approach for instructors and language skill development in learners, to discuss the process of integration into the classroom, and review possible usages with the introduction of flipped approach into the English classroom with regards to reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Throughout this paper, the term flipped classroom technology approach and integration have been defined. An explanation of the use of the flipped approach is given. Previous studies and research on the use of the flipped classroom technology approach, in order to improve English language learning skills, in the classroom have been reviewed and discussed. Positive ways this teaching methodology could be used to assist learners to improve their English language skills are also suggested.',\n",
       " 'English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education not only requires students to receive in-class instruction but also necessitates them to engage in extra practices outside the classroom by using technological or non-technological resources. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the self-directed language learning behaviors of the EFL student teachers and their use of technology in the process by employing a mixed-methods study within an explanatory sequential research design. The quantitative data were collected from 110 EFL student teachers by using two distinct research instruments, whereas the qualitative data were collected through an open-ended questionnaire form, responded by 47 of these students. The results of the study indicated that technology utilization is a significant predictor of self-directed language learning. However, the findings show that the off-campus self-directed language learning abilities of the students, with or without the use of technology, do not significantly differ according to gender, age, and grade levels. The differences were only found in terms of unaided off-campus learning abilities of the students and their technology utilization frequency in language learning. The qualitative findings also show that students engage in a variety of self-directed language learning activities outside the classroom mostly by using technology.',\n",
       " \"Realizing academic integrity in the digital age becomes a nightmare for universities and educational institutions in the entire globe. After the spread of Information and Communication Technology, dishonesty has replaced ethical considerations in research. The focal reasons behind this increasing dilemma are the researchers' attitudes and their different cultural perspectives. The spread of Information and Communication Technology provides avenues for academic dishonesty since detecting software products do not offer a real solution. As such, the incentive of this study is to scrutinize how Information and Communication Technology can help in attaining academic integrity. It also intends to see what is behind the backdrop of the academic misconduct, i.e., the motives that lead researchers to switch to e-dishonesty. The present survey seeks to bring the issue of Information and Communication Technology and academic integrity into the light to ensure honesty among the Algerian researchers. The researcher collected data through a questionnaire addressed to four Masterclasses in English studies at Mascara and Saida Universities supported by an interview with teachers. The findings revealed that most students used technology in cheating and plagiarism. The findings also revealed that universities and institutions can achieve integrity if the learners are aware of the positive side of Information and Communication Technology in academic research.\",\n",
       " \"This study investigated how Thai EFL pre-service teachers (PSTs) use technology in their classrooms and the level of substitution, augmentation, modification, and redefinition (SAMR) they implement. Seven English education majors enrolled in the course &quot;teaching internship 2&quot; in their fourth year at a Thai university participated in the study. Due to COVID-19, the participants were trained to teach online, but during their teaching practicum, they were required to teach in a traditional on-site setting. Because of this novel arrangement, it was essential to investigate how these PSTs incorporate technology into the classroom. For the purpose of analyzing the process of educational technology integration, this study employed SAMR model. Observations and semi-structured interviews were used as data collection methods. Throughout the semester, observations were conducted twice. SAMR observation form was used to investigate how PSTs used technology in their teaching. Participants were asked to participate in an interview after each observation. The interviews included open-ended questions based on the conceptual framework of SAMR. Observation results show that technological tools were used to engage students, check comprehension, create teaching content, and evaluate students' understanding. For the study, the participants were divided into three groups based on the extent of technological tools used. One participant was deemed to be in the substitution stage, five participants in the augmentation stage, and only one participant in the modification stage. The results of the interviews indicated that teacher motivation and the availability of ICT equipment, as well as familiarity with technological tools, played a significant role in PSTs' integration of technology into the classroom. The study's conclusions are helpful in developing PSTs' technology integration in EFL classrooms. SAMR model should be introduced to PSTs to let them critically reflect on and develop their own technology integration.\",\n",
       " \"Inspired from sociocultural theory, the present research is an interpretive and qualitative study of teachers' beliefs development through participation in scaffolded dialogues in order to raise their awareness of technology-enhanced language instruction longitudinally. In doing so, 20 teachers, whose informed consent was obtained, were invited to take part in interview sessions three times and join in the sessions of scaffolded dialogues for six months. Classroom observations were also randomly done in order to investigate the relationship between teachers' theoretical knowledge of technology with their practical understanding of using mobile apps and computer software in the classroom. In addition, the participant teachers' classroom transcripts were subjected to qualitative investigation through conversation analysis to confirm the findings gathered from observations. Results revealed teachers' gradual development of their beliefs regarding their &quot;little-to-no awareness of technology&quot; to &quot;relative awareness of technology&quot; and finally toward &quot;raised awareness of technology&quot;. Data gathered from classroom observations highlighted the strong alignment between teachers' beliefs and actions in using technological devices to create more interaction resulting in the students' increased self-confidence to take part in doing online tasks. Conversation analysis of teacher-learner interactions verified the findings of classroom observations by concluding that, to a very large extent, teachers' raised awareness of technology-enhanced instruction was evidenced in the participant teachers' practice teaching in which they could successfully and consciously apply technological devices in the classroom. As to the implication side, the present study calls for teacher education to familiarize teachers with the most recent theoretical and practical aspects of technology-enhanced instruction by encouraging them to benefit from scaffolded dialogues and share their practice teaching experience for the purpose of quality teaching and learning through technology-mediated classroom.\",\n",
       " 'The online course offerings have grown exponentially globally since the turn of the 21st century--be they as a primary mode of instruction or as a supplement to traditional face-to-face classroom instruction, and this phenomenon is most noticeable in higher education. More recently, the new technology has also been integrated into the English as a Foreign Language, henceforth called EFL, classrooms. This article argues that the notion of technology-enhanced language learning is not just an intriguing idea--it is a necessity, for it has a great potential to offer in facilitating the development of English language proficiency of EFL learners through computer-mediated communication. Additionally, it contends that the new technology can potentially address most, if not all, of the shortcomings inherent to the EFL classroom including, but not limited to, lack of exposure to the target language, lack of practice, and lack of learning resources. Theoretical implications of technology-enhanced language teaching and learning will also be explored.',\n",

Despite substantial expansion over the past two decades, its successful adoption raises several challenges for teachers. Teachers turn to information and communication technologies (ICT) to solve their problems. This study aims to investigate technology acceptance and use of English language teachers adopting the CLIL approach in Turkey, and to identify the difficulties they encounter while integrating technology into practice. The study is explanatory in research design and employs the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) developed by Davis (1989) as a framework. A 27-item Likert-type questionnaire was used to gather data from 61 teachers practicing in private and public schools. The results showed a statistically significant difference in technology integration intention and use behaviors of teachers. The qualitative data suggested that among the difficulties faced by CLIL teachers were facilitating environments, managerial assistance, and teacher technology awareness.',\n",

The wealth of any nation in the information age is dependent upon its human capital, which is valuable in direct proportion to its level of education and training. There are a number of factors that bear directly on the quality of education; one is technology. Technology can and is transforming education. It is a powerful tool to supplement teacher training and preparation. Teacher quality is also crucial, and there is a growing shortage of talented, well-qualified teachers around the world, especially in the fields of math and science. Decentralization is a growing trend in education around the world, as  countries with strong traditions of centralized educational institutions look for ways to capture the dynamism and innovation that may accompany a loosening of central control. The demand for higher education is increasing most rapidly, and is direct function of the growing importance of technology and the importance of human capital; it is higher education that most effectively makes people \"capital intensive.\" A function of growing globalization of the world\\'s economy is an increasing level of international educational exchanges.

To achieve this goal, seventy-six English teachers in AlJouf district of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia responded to a questionnaire, showing that the teachers held positive attitudes toward the use of technology in the classroom. However, the participants reported several critical barriers to widespread use. These included a) the lack of teacher training, b) the lack of infrastructure (labs and classrooms), and c) the lack of technology resources (computers). The survey results suggested the need for an explicit vision and strategy for technology use.

       " 'Background: Almost every aspect of modern life is affected in some way by technology.  Many people utilize technology from dawn to dusk to communicate; make decisions; reflect, gain, synthesize, evaluate or distribute information, among many other functions.  One would be hard pressed to find a single professional, regardless of career field, going through an entire work day without touching a computer, PDA or other electronic device. However, the same level of technology use cannot be found in many schools, which are meant to prepare students for their future lives and careers in the \"real\" world. Purpose: The topic of this paper is to review recent literature pertaining to the use of technology in literacy instruction. In particular, the paper reports findings regarding effective methods for teaching low-achieving or at-risk student groups. Setting: This paper is an analysis of several studies conducted across the United States. Study Sample: This paper is an analysis of several studies conducted across the United States. Research Design: Descriptive; Experimental; Quasi-experimental; Narrative Synthesis; and Qualitative. Findings: Technology can be used to bridge the early gap in exposure to print for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Internet-based reading programs are available. Students can access electronic books, interactive stories and leveled reading passages (Tracey & Young, 2005) or full texts through publicly available archives. If students lack hardware or internet access in the home, these resources can be accessed in the school building although use may be limited by space and time (Legutko, 2007). In addition, some districts may have access to reading software through federally funded programs or studies which often target specific skills and age groups (Means et al, 2007). In addition, technology can be used to provide instructional opportunities for students where both parents work outside the home or work second- or third-shift. Microsoft NetMeeting is a tool included in older Microsoft operating systems that has web conferencing, audio, interactive whiteboard and chat capabilities (Legutko, 2007). Tutors and mentors can use this or another similar program such as a web-based instant messenger or e-mail to communicate with and instruct students whose parents may be unavailable for homework help in the afternoons or evenings (Burns, 2006). Finally, technology can offer additional independent reinforcement for low-performing students in schools that cannot afford to lower teacher-student ratios. The studies show that students spent a greater portion of their day engaged in independent practice with teachers as facilitators and monitors when technology is integrated (Means et al, 2007). With the student leading his own independent practice and the technological tool providing support or feedback, technology can act as another teacher in the room when districts cannot afford to hire more teachers or paraprofessionals. In addition, mentors and tutors can be incorporated at little or no cost through web conferencing or chat tools (Burns, 2006). Conclusion: Although a great deal of technology exists for use in the classroom as an instructional or administrative tool, there has been very little research conducted on its effectiveness outside the arena of reading comprehension. This review of literature justifies a call for increased study on the topic, not only on specific software products, but on more specific and diverse outcomes such as reading motivation, engagement and metacognition. In the meantime, there are many benefits that can be enjoyed by both educators and students - greater and more affordable access to leveled texts, more time spent on independent practice, increased access to tutors and mentors and variable effects on technological savvy and reading engagement.

       " \"The purpose of this study was to integrate technology into technology-rich, English language learning classrooms in Saudi Arabia. Technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) framework was used to design activities of technology integration for teachers' and students' achievement and effectiveness. This study used a mixed-method of quantitative and qualitative to collect data. All participants were male teachers who taught English language courses in public Saudi Arabian schools. Participants were gender specific because the school system in Saudi Arabia separates males and females. The researcher, who was also male, had access to the male portion of the education system and, thus, interviewed and observed only teachers and students. Two research-developed pre- and post-surveys were administered to participants digitally. The researcher conducted observations and in-depth, recorded interviews with each teacher (n = 2). Also, an in-depth recorded interview was conducted with students (n = 2) for data analysis to provide depth to the student perspective collected. The results showed that TPACK framework is an effective tool for both teachers and students to enhance teaching and learning if it is well implemented and used. Teachers in this study showed interest for a better future of education with technology being well integrated and used in the curriculum. Implications of this study are clear that teachers will be more ready and productive with technology integration once technology is part of education laws and policy.

       " 'To gauge the success of integrating technology into classrooms which is among the popular topics in the field of language learning, there is a need to understand how end users, language learners, use technology and bear the characteristics of digital learner as claimed for the current generation of learners. To this end, this study collected data through a survey design from 1163 university level English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners to provide cross-cultural, empirical evidence towards building an accurate picture of EFL learners in the digital age. Data were analysed through factor analysis to identify meaningful patterns of technology use, descriptive statistics and correlations to explore the relationships between technology use patterns, language achievement and digital characteristics. Findings suggest that EFL learners are digital learners at a moderate level and the range of technology tools used both for daily and language learning purposes is not as broad as claimed for their generation. The results of the study carry implications for EFL practitioners aiming at better understanding current EFL learners and providing them with technology-integrated language instruction properly.',\n",

       " \"This study investigates self-reported attitudes about technology-enhanced language learning in the flipped classroom across borders in three tertiary-level contexts. As a method to address students' needs for twenty-first century education, the flipped classroom pedagogical approach was chosen to explore student attitudes towards technology for language learning in credit-bearing language courses in USA and Macau and non-credit-bearing courses in Colombia. This study implemented an experimental design with a mixed methods approach for data collection. Data was collected from a technology survey, focus group sessions, and reflective essays. Before each class, students in the experimental groups in all three countries previewed lessons and engaged in activities through online videos and screencasts in order to better prepare for in class activities. Results showed that the USA experimental group showed a statistically significant difference in all self-reported attitudes in using technology for language learning overtime. Between groups statistical analyses found flipped classrooms experienced a statistically significant different change in self-reported attitudes on instrumentality, digital literacy, and anxiety. Overall, students in the USA and Columbian contexts may have less anxiety about using technology for language learning in a flipped classroom, and the flipped classroom may positively impact students' attitudes towards technology in Columbia, Macau, and USA.\",\n",

       " 'Using both data from my dissertation and ideas from my most recent research and academic projects, this paper will discuss some challenges and potential opportunities that the inextricable links between literacy and technology pose for second language educators in this decade and beyond. In the first part of this paper, I will describe a series of considerations about the use of technology within literacy development. These ideas from a group of teachers and teacher educators suggest that a heightened sense of audience, more access to writing genres within technological devices, and more availability of resources are some of the advantages of these connections between literacy and technology. However, they also believed that teachers need to make better sense of how to use and maximize technology for literacy development in their classroom and teacher education programs. The second part of the paper will introduce two ongoing proposals that, in my opinion, are helping address these issues that these participants described. Both proposals look at ideas such as multimodality as a concept that illustrates how to best link literacy and technology. The first proposal is the creation of WebQuests within one of the preservice courses at UPB-Medellín. The second proposal is the multinational research project &quot;Learning by Design&quot;. This section of the paper will explain what each is about, how it is being carried out, and the possibilities for other researchers to contribute to these ideas in their own contexts.',\n",
       " \"The problem addressed in this study was that K-12 teachers feel underprepared to incorporate technology to support English language learners (ELLs) in the general education classroom. Current research shows teachers' unpreparedness stems from their limited access to appropriate training. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to examine K-12 teachers' perceptions of their current preparedness and preparedness needs to incorporate technology to support ELLs in the general education classroom. The technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) theoretical framework was used to support this study. Primary data were collected via semi-structured interviews with 10 participants selected via purposive sampling. Secondary data were collected via a document review of the selected district's ESOL Endorsement courses. A combination of thematic and content analyses were conducted to cross-reference the primary and secondary data. Three themes emerged during the analysis: (a) teachers feel unprepared to integrate technology for ELLs in the general education classroom; (b) teachers feel they need training to integrate technology for ELLs in the general education classroom; (c) limited training requirements impact teachers' ability to incorporate technology for ELLs. The findings support that general education teachers' lack of access to training opportunities focused on using educational technology to support ELLs negatively affects their ability to integrate educational technology into the classroom to support ELLs' language and academic achievement. It is recommended that district leaders use the findings from this study to understand the specific training needs of teachers pertaining to technology use for supporting ELLs to decide if initial and current training opportunities and frequency require revision or restructuring.

Third generation activity theory and Engeström and Sannino's (J Organ Change Manag 24(3):368-387, 2011) methodological framework for the identification and analysis of different types of discursive manifestations of contradictions are used to identify tensions within and between the activity systems of the teachers and school management related to the expectation that teachers make use of the school's investment in technology. Four types of contradictions are identified: a dilemma related to teachers' perceived value and use of technology for personal and professional purposes; a conflict focused on the support required for teachers' technology integration; a conflict related to teachers' workload and a critical conflict related to the silencing of teachers in decision making. The identification of these contradictions highlights the necessity for policy makers, school leaders, teachers and the research community to work collaboratively to ensure that students have opportunities to use technology for their social, civic and economic well-being.\",\n",

       " \"With the development of technology, the quantity and quality of electronic devices for students learning English as a second or foreign language (ESL/EFL) are on the rise, especially since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. To facilitate practices in English language education for students with special needs, the researchers conducted a systematic review of the empirical studies of technology tools for ESL/EFL students with learning difficulties published in the previous two decades. This paper presents the study selection process and findings of the review based on 16 peer-reviewed journal articles and one book chapter. The paper reveals the frequent mental and physical difficulties of English language learning and the typical technology tools employed in and out of class. More importantly, this paper discusses the roles of these technology tools in students' English language acquisition, specifically their effects on student learning outcomes and the students' perceptions toward them. With limited primary sources, this paper calls for more attention to the use of technology in English language learning of ESL/EFL students identified as at-risk and with learning disabilities and raises some implications for future research and instructional practices.\",\n",

       " 'Arguing against the common perception of technology as passive, neutral, and universal, this article presents a theoretical analysis of a commonly used and frequently studied technology--Computer Mediated Communication (CMC)--to illustrate how a technology that is often undistinguished in practice and research is indeed active, biased, and specific. We then report two exploratory studies that attempt to test the proposed framework with empirical evidence. The findings suggest that differences in the features of two CMC sub-technologies result in different effects on student-student interactions and vocabulary learning. We are able to both theoretically and empirically demonstrate that CMC technology can be realized in multiple forms and shapes, each of which has its own individual characteristics. These different characteristics are distributed across four different dimensions: temporality, spatiality, identity, and modality. Depending on their relative location on these dimensions, these characteristics have significant impact on student online behaviors in terms of social, linguistic, and psychological expressions. Although the two empirical studies were preliminary due to their sample size and quasi-experimental nature, they did positively confirm the view that each technology has unique features that actively shapes potential uses and users.',\n",

The aim of the study was to explore stakeholders' perceptions related to technology acceptance of &quot;Reading Progress&quot; in Microsoft Teams. By using one Trilingual Program at a Secondary School in Thailand as a case study, this study adopted a qualitative approach to investigate technology acceptance of 9 EFL students, 2 EFL teachers, and 1 program administrator in the studied program using focus group interview data. Grounded within Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the findings revealed that all participants perceived &quot;Reading Progress&quot; as a computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) tool, with the EFL teachers and program administrator also viewing &quot;Reading Progress&quot; as a teaching assistant tool for personalized teaching and learning. The perceived usefulness resulted from the participants' perceived ease of use of &quot;Reading Progress.&quot; However, familiarity with technology and perceived enjoyment also played a significant role in understanding technology acceptance in the studied EFL context.

       " \"The objective of this study was to investigate the ways that instructors think about classroom technology and how this might relate to their classroom use of it. This qualitative case study explores the relationship between instructors and classroom information/communication technology (ICT). Specifically, this study followed three native English-speaking English Language instructors at a South Korean vocational college over the course of a semester. Through a variety of data collection methods, many different aspects of the participants' relationships with instructional ICT were explored. This study focused on participants' espoused ideas and beliefs about what ICT was, how it was meant to be used, and what it could accomplish in a classroom setting. In addition to interviews, instructors' actual technology usage was explored through classroom observations. The findings strongly suggest that instructors' relationships to instructional ICT are differentiated individually by a number of factors, such as an instructor's history of learning and teaching with ICT, their understanding of what it is, and what it can and cannot do. By exploring these individual instructors' perspectives and their use of ICTs in their classrooms, this study makes a case that the educational impact and benefit of ICT should be understood as a result of relationships between instructors and technology, or in broader terms, relationships between humans and machines. Furthermore, it was found that instructors' relationships with instructional technology can be understood in terms of their ability to reshape it and apply it in innovative ways to accomplish their pedagogical goals. To aid in this understanding, the findings are used to posit, develop, and refine two theoretical constructs, &quot;technological agency&quot; and &quot;ideologies of technology&quot;. These are offered as conceptual lenses through which to view one particular aspect of a instructor's relationship to technology, that of reinterpretation of technological artifacts through the discovery of new affordances. By casting the instructor as the interpreter and employer of educational technology, and the true key to its success, this dissertation stands as a response to deterministic and/or essentialist notions of technology in classrooms.

A total of 10 out of the 30 teachers completed the survey. Data analysis indicated that there was a great need for, and support for, using technology in the classroom to assist ESL students. Many teachers needed training  because they lacked the technological skills to make this an efficient teaching method for them. Teachers noted a need to know what types of technologies were available for use in their individual classrooms so they could receive the most appropriate training.

One hundred sixty undergraduates from a Chinese university participated in the 14-week quasi-experiment. Both groups were taught in a flipped fashion. The treatment group was required to use the ASR technology for oral practice in their pre-class self-learning, while the control group conducted their self-learning without the ASR technology. The results found that the ASR-based oral practice led to a significant between-group difference in students' WTC with teacher and class and WTC with non-Chinese, showing that the ASR technology may contribute to improving the Chinese students' WTC in oral English. Conversely, except for the between-group effect on negotiation for meaning, there was no significant difference between the two groups on the other measures of interactional features. Moreover, none of the interactional features of the students in the treatment group changed significantly over time, indicating a limited role of the ASR technology on Chinese students' interactional features. Discussions were conducted regarding the contradictory effects of the ASR technology on WTC and peer interaction.\",\n",

       " \"The introduction of information and communication technology (ICT) to education creates new learning paradigms. We are dwelling in a world which technology has reduced to a global village and the breakthrough in technology is underpinning pedagogical submissions. It may become imperative therefore to have a rethinking on how to ameliorate the constraints of second language users through the applications of modern technologies. The interactions between new technology and pedagogical submissions have been found to an extent to be addressing the heterogeneous needs of second language learners and any global discovery which aims at minimizing learners' constraints is a welcome development in a rapidly changing world of technology. This paper therefore is an overview presentation of how modern technologies can be of assistance to both teachers and students of a second language setting. The rapid growth in ICT experienced by the technologically advanced nations of the world has helped them to overcome some of the barriers in teaching and learning. Applications of modern day's technologies in the field of teaching and learning can make it possible for teachers, students and others to join communities of people well beyond their immediate environment to critically review, analyze, contribute, criticize and organize issues logically and contextually having professionalism and the transformations of the entire society in view. Now, new technologies such as the reported computer enhancements with new software and networking make it much easier for educators to conquer space and time, with the motive of ameliorating constraints and academic conflicting issues. We can now bring learning to virtually any place on earth anytime for the purpose of achieving the desirable learning outcomes.\",\n",
       " \"This study endeavored to gain insights into English as a Foreign Language (EFL) preferred strategies in teaching EFL writing during the pandemic, particularly dealing with technology use. Six writing teachers from various universities in East Java, Indonesia, participated in this study. They were asked to respond to interview questions that were based on Lee's (2017) five categories of technology use in a writing class and Chi's (2009) Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive (ICAP) taxonomy levels. Thematic analysis of the interview data revealed that five teachers managed to use technological tools in all five categories of technology usage, with the self- and peer-evaluation categories being the most frequently used. They were also able to conduct activities in all of the ICAP taxonomy levels, although some technical issues and students' factors hindered the students from being fully engaged in the lessons. Lastly, the experience of integrating technology in the online writing class during the pandemic resulted in a moderately optimistic view by the teachers on technological integration in future onsite classes. It is recommended that the government and educational institutions provide support in terms of infrastructure, facilities, and professional development training in technology usage for teachers, especially for those who teach in remote regions.\",\n",
       " 'The aim of the study was to investigate how well language teacher education (LTE) programmes prepare future teachers for ICT integration with the comparison of three different contexts (Turkey, Portugal and Poland) from the perspectives of the teacher trainees and teacher educators (TEs). Using a scale and multiple interviews, the data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. The results revealed that although there were three different contexts in three countries, LTE programmes seemed to implement teacher education strategies so as to prepare future teachers for educational technology use similarly at a moderate level. Modelling TEs and reflection on technology use were found to be significant strategies followed while feedback and instructional design strategies were challenging for the programmes. Furthermore, the results also indicated limited access to resources, lack of institutional support and qualified TEs who could successfully use and integrate technology into their teaching. Based on the findings, implications on how to integrate technology training into LTE programmes are discussed.',\n",
       " 'The aim of the present study was to raise awareness related to the postmodern educational philosophies, and to the opportunities provided by the emerging technologies and conditions of our era with regard to foreign language (FL) education. The main discussion was that educators and educational practices are not in complete harmony with the recent products of technology or with the needs, interests, and habits of the learners. The current work proposed Second Life (SL) as a useful model to focus on and investigate in order to derive some theoretical and practical guidelines and conclusions that will be consistent with all philosophies, applications, stakeholders, instruments, and conditions in educational settings in the current age of technology and in the future. The present study concluded that the administrative side of education has fallen far behind the progress in technology, and thus remains quite traditional and static, which creates a paradoxical situation suggesting that the teaching part has lost its power and efficiency, while the learning part continues to be innovative and creative.',\n",
       " \"Digital storytelling, which combines the art of storytelling with a variety of digital audio, video, and multimedia images, has been increasingly used as a language learning tool as research studies have shown it to be effective in enhancing the development of language skills as well as related language learning skills, such as autonomy, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. However, before successful language learning can take place, teachers' concerns regarding technology adoption has to be explored, especially since there is very little research in this area in the Malaysian context. This study addresses this gap in knowledge by sharing the concerns of four English as Second Language (ESL) instructors in terms of their attitudes and acceptance of the use of technology in the form of digital storytelling in teaching ESL at a Malaysian public university. &quot;Concern&quot; in this study refers to the evoked feelings and perceptions towards an innovation and the change process. The data of the study are drawn from the Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ) and interviews of the instructors. The findings revealed that the teachers perceive the technology to be beneficial to their students to a certain extent; however, resistance to the technology was particularly strong in two of the instructors and this could lead to failure in technology integration.\",\n",

       " \"This study addresses the overlooked aspect of evaluating pre-service teachers' preparedness for technology-based instruction. Focusing on EFL pre-service teachers at a remote university, it explores their readiness to integrate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into teaching while navigating associated challenges. Employing a mixed-method design, data were collected through a Likert scale questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. Participants included pre-service EFL teachers enrolled in an English education program at a university in East Nusa Tenggara. The findings highlight the region's pre-service teachers' readiness to incorporate technology, despite encountering barriers such as inadequate knowledge, perception, confidence, financial constraints, limited student access, and inadequate facilities. Consequently, universities must consistently provide assistance, instruction, and essential resources, ensuring prospective educators acquire the necessary skills to integrate technology into future pedagogical inquiries seamlessly.\",\n",

       " \"Educational speaking technology is a digital expertise used to enhance speaking performance. This research examined the effects of using educational speaking technology tools: FORVO, YouGlish, and OALD 8th ed. to enhance students' speaking performance. A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest two groups design was used. Test, questionnaire, interview, and teacher-log were used to gather the data from 82 first-year Information communication and Technology (IT) students selected through comprehensive sampling. The experimental group students had learned speaking skills through educational speaking technology tools while the control group students learned using the conventional method. When the quantitative data were analyzed through independent samples T-test, the qualitative data were analyzed through thematic analysis. The findings of the study uncovered that there was a statistical difference between the experimental and control group students in their speaking performance. Accordingly, the learners who had learned through educational speaking technology have enhanced their speaking performance compared to the students that learned conventionally. Predominantly, students who learned through educational speaking technology were fluent, coherent, and accurate in their speech, rich in lexical resources, used a variety of grammatical ranges, and better in pronunciation. Besides, the students' have positive perceptions towards using educational speaking technology tools. Consequently, this study recommends researchers, teachers, and students to make the use of educational technology and to go in line with the state of the art.\",\n",
       " \"A review of literature on mobile technology in EFL learning environment has indicated the growth, trends and practices of smartphones and mobile apps adoption both in classroom and outside classroom settings. However, little has been known on how EFL teachers perceived such trends and current practices and how they plan for future teaching. This study attempted to explore teachers' responses to trends and practices of mobile technology adoption and their future teaching plan. To this end, a qualitative design was adopted with two consecutive research procedures: a systematic review on the selected trends and practices analysis studies on mobile technology for language learning practices and a survey through a semi-structured interview. Five EFL teachers (three females and two males) from secondary school level were interviewed using six open-ended questions. Findings of the study revealed that teachers perceived positively towards the trends and practices of mobile technology in and outside language learning classroom. Teachers perceived motivation as a main driver to incorporate mobile technology. Some of motivations frequently cited in the interviews with the sampled teachers revealed the current trends and practices of blended learning practices among Indonesian teachers, including the perceived benefits of mobile technology adoptions and the effect of mobile technology on teaching and learning practices and students' characteristics. Three challenges were identified when technology was incorporated for learning namely infrastructure related issues, teacher technological knowledge and education policy.\",\n",
       " \"Technology has been used widely in the field of education for a long period of time. It is a useful tool which could be a mediation to help language learners to learn the target language. In order to investigate how technology and social experience can be integrated into courses to promote language learners' desire to learn English, the researcher combined Gardner's socio-psychological system and students' social experience (social construction, cooperative learning, and communicative competence) as guides to explore their motivation (desire to learn English). 315 students from two Taiwanese universities taking English courses were involved in this study. The data included 35 Likert-scaled questions, 11 demographic information questions, and two open-ended questions. Regression analysis, and correlation coefficient were conducted to analyze the data. Based on the findings, learning with technology, technology experience and social experience had positive relationship with their desire to learn English, and learning with technology and social experience were also strong predictors of desire to learn English. Because integrating technology and social experience in language learning appeared to benefit desire to learn English, educators might consider including these elements throughout their language-learning curriculum to promote students' learning motivation.\",\n",
       " \"The purpose of this research is to model the link between language learners' socioeconomic status (SES), their self-directed, technology-enhanced language learning, and their language achievement. The participants of this study are 382 university students taking part in a survey related to their perceptions of their self-directed, technology-enhanced language learning in addition to their experience of language learning at school and in private institutes. Parental income has been used as a proxy to the learners' SES. Their language outcome has been operationalised by their performance in the English section of the nation-wide entrance exam and their pre-university course. The results of path analysis revealed that EFL learners' SES is a significant predictor of their autonomous language learning with technology and their language achievement. Furthermore, students' out-of-class engagement with technology was positively associated with their performance in the English section of the nation-wide exam.\",\n",
       " \"One of the main challenges that US schools face in educating English language learners is developing their academic literacy. This paper presents case studies of two K-12 schools that successfully employ high-technology environments, including laptop computers for each student, toward the development of English language learners' academic language proficiency and academic literacy. In the first school, Latino fourth-grade students use laptops and other new technologies for a wide variety of pre- and post-reading tasks as part of their effort to transition from learning to read to reading to learn. In the second school, diverse immigrant and refugee students at the middle school level combine technology use with Expeditionary Learning to carry out community projects leading to the development of sophisticated products. In both schools, technology is used to engage students in cognitively demanding activity, motivate independent reading, and provide scaffolding for language development, while the researchers also made use of technology to document learning processes and outcomes. Taken together, the schools offer valuable lessons for utilization of technology to promote academic literacy among culturally and linguistically diverse students.\",\n",
       " \"The technology has entered our life day by day and the effects of this are felt in English language teaching and learning, as well as it does in the education. This study aims to investigate the relationship between Turkish EFL teachers' technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) skills and attitudes towards technology. This research also examined whether Turkish EFL teachers' TPACK skills and their attitudes towards technology differs according to the gender, FATIH project training and professional experience. This research was conducted with 721 Turkish EFL teachers working in 81 provinces of Turkey. Correlational survey model was used in this study. &quot;TPACK Implementation Scale&quot; and &quot;Attitude Scale towards Technology&quot; were used as data collection tools. Arithmetic mean, standard deviation, t test, ANOVA and Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient were used in data analysis. As a result of the study, it was determined that Turkish EFL teachers' TPACK skills and attitudes towards technology were at high level. While the attitudes of Turkish EFL teachers towards technology did not show a significant difference according to gender, FATIH project training and professional experience, the female teachers and the teachers who got the FATIH Project training had higher TPACK skills. However, it was found that TPACK skills of the teachers did not differ significantly according to the professional experience. In addition, it was concluded that there is a low, positive and significant relationship between teachers' TPACK skills and attitudes towards technology.\",\n",
       " \"Quality education is undoubtedly a global concern, tied closely to preoccupations with economic and social development. Increasingly, the adoption and effective use of current technology tools are being recognized as visible signs of that quality. Scholars are providing increasing evidence of the kinds of empowered teacher identities that will adopt the effective use of technology tools in teaching. Less is being discussed about how technology can support the processes needed to mediate such identities. The context of Teacher Education is a strategic place to begin to initiate such processes. Our aim in this article is twofold: 1) to describe two recent examples of innovative, technology-supported mentoring processes that were conducted in the context of an EFL Teacher Education program in Chile; 2) to revisit the findings of these studies in light of new evidence from participants who have moved on in their careers. This evidence is viewed in the framework of recent scholarship on the responsibilities that Teacher Education plays in their development. The first 16-month study examined the influences of a guided reading program involving e-readers on the identities and literacy skills of pre-service teachers. The second was a student-conceived study. That inquiry sought to determine the influence of upper year students' peer mentoring, made available partly through a social media site (SMS), on the identities and investment in learning of 12 first-year students in the pedagogy program. The initial evidence from ethnographic tools used in both studies indicated that the participants were struggling with confidence and doubting themselves as knowledgeable, effective future teachers--not predictive of a potential for quality teaching. Positive signs at the end of both studies and more recent reports from participants suggest that the mentoring had longitudinal benefits for some, although not uniformly. The potential of apprenticeship and mentoring in a technology-supported environment requires rethinking Teacher Education mandates if we are to empower emerging teachers to be quality teachers.\",\n",
       " \"There is an assumption that technology-based materials are acquisition-rich input, and listening plays a significant role in daily communication as well as the education process. This study aims to examine the effect of technology-based materials on the student's listening ability in EFL classes and elicit students' and teachers' perceptions about the use of technology-based materials for the development of listening skills. In the current study, a mixed-methods research design was adopted. Quantitative data was gathered through pre and posttest results with the participation of 168 pre-advanced English students studying in a vocational high school in Turkey. Qualitative data were obtained from the semi-structured interviews conducted at the end of implementation to identify the teachers' and students' perceptions about the use of technology-based materials. The quantitative data were examined through statistical analyses via SPSS 25, and content analysis was employed to analyze the qualitative data. The results indicated that both technology-based materials and textbook-based materials helped listening skill development. Technology-based materials proved to be slightly more effective than textbook-based materials in quantitative results. Moreover, this study also shows that most of the respondents preferred technology-based materials over textbook-based materials and were motivated in the classroom when using them.\",\n",
       " 'This review of the theoretical framework for Mastery Learning Theory and Sense of Community theories is provided in conjunction with a review of the literature for mobile technology in relation to language learning. Although empirical research is minimal for mobile phone technology as an aid for language learning, the empirical research that exists positively points toward mobile phone technology as a tool that is becoming more widely used and accepted by second language teachers. A conceptual application of the theoretical frameworks is applied to the use of mobile phone technology as a teaching aid for language learners, with the conclusion that there is an overlap worth researching empirically.',\n",
       " \"Integration of technology in the teaching/learning process has caused many changes in education in recent years. In addition, due to the pandemic that surrounded the world at the beginning of 2020, schools had to switch from face-to-face to distance education; therefore, the need for technology use and expansion of online applications became inevitable. As a result of this massive change in education and the emergence of online applications as language learning tools, this evaluation study investigates Edpuzzle, Flipgrid, Padlet, and Quizlet that are created as educational applications used in English language classes. The paper starts with the hegemony of technology in education and then continues with the evaluation of these online applications. Lastly how to use these applications effectively in English as a foreign language (EFL) classrooms is discussed. It can be reported that EDpuzzle can mostly be used for authentic video sessions; Flipgrid is effective on online speaking skills; Padlet is helpful with students' writing skills, and lastly, Quizlet is beneficial for vocabulary teaching. It can be concluded that online applications are likely to result in effective assistance of learning and practicing both for language teachers/students and learning/teaching processes.\",\n",
       " \"A significant body of literacy and language research over the last two decades has been informed by a sociocultural perspective and an associated qualitative design, which are often seen as valuable and appropriate for researching literacy. As an emergent researcher, whose understanding of language education was mostly informed by individualistic psychology and linguistics, I encountered a significant challenge in designing a project for my Masters research undertaken in Australia in which I aimed at examining international students' technology use in English as a second language (ESL) and their challenges. Researching the experiences with technology, which might be so unique and personal, required a major shift in the way I viewed the world and thought about literacy and technology. Informed by autoethnography, this paper is written in a form of a narrative in which I draw on my educational and teaching experiences in the USSR and, after its collapse, in the newly independent country Belarus, to explore the origins of my early positivist views on language teaching and technology use. I discuss how these understandings have been challenged and changed through a major epistemological shift during my Masters research and how this shift has influenced the research methodology of my current doctoral study. Some reflections about the value of autoethnography to explore research experiences are discussed. Finally, I argue that such reflective practice may help emerging scholars to understand who they are, how they are positioned and what their goals as researchers are. (Contains 2 footnotes.)\",\n",
       " \"This study seeks to contribute to the small, but growing area of research regarding technology potential in the field of vocabulary research. The study aims to determine the usefulness of augmented reality (AR) technology in EFL vocabulary learning. An experiment was conducted to examine young learners' motivation and vocabulary retention. The current study employed two instruments: a pre-post-delayed test and an interview. The participants (N=73) were primary school sixth-graders (11-12 years old) and were assigned into two groups, experimental (38) and control (35). The findings revealed that there were differences in the mean scores in favour of the experimental group. However, these differences were not statistically significant. Furthermore, seventeen students were interviewed regarding their perceptions of the used technology. The findings showed that AR results in better understanding and higher levels of motivation among students. The study also highlighted the role of technology in the domain of language learning.\",\n",
       " \"A 21st century teacher must communicate in the language and style of their students to ensure that their learning is meaningful. However, this is challenging, especially for teachers who are less familiar with using technology in teaching. To inspire a group of ESL 'digital immigrant' teachers, a professional learning community (PLC) was set up. PLC consisted of both pre-service teachers (digital natives) and in-service teachers (digital immigrants). The two groups exchanged knowledge through a series of sharing sessions to demonstrate the technical aspects of technology, as well as to provide an understanding that technology has affordances and constraints. This case study investigates a group of in-service teachers who adopted the IDDIRR instructional design model (introduce, demonstrate, develop, implement, reflect, revise) to develop technology-based lessons for their ESL classrooms. The data for this study were collected through three main instruments: surveys, interviews and written reflections. The survey data was descriptively analysed using SPSS Version 24, while the reflection and interview data were assessed using thematic analysis. The findings suggest that the IDDIRR-TPACK + PLC model, along with a supportive PLC environment and the presence of more knowledgeable peers (MKO), helped enhance teachers' TPACK and inspired them to integrate more technology in their classrooms.\",\n",
       " \"The purpose of this article is to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of computer technology and Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) programs for current second language learning. According to the National Clearinghouse for English Language Acquisition & Language Instruction Educational Programs' report (2002), more than nine million students are limited English Proficiency (LEP) in American classrooms every year, learning how to use the computer technology and its attached language learning programs to assist those students is a significant and urgent subject. In fact, the application of computer technology and CALL programs has become a new trend in recently global second language learning instructions. Research findings have proven that the use of computer technology has a positive effect on the achievement levels of English as Second Language (ESL) students, but it still has its limitations and weaknesses, such as financial, isolated, and knowledge required issues. The authors emphasize that we must recognize both advantages and disadvantages of using computer so we can get the maximum effectiveness of technology to enhance second language learning.\",\n",
       " \"This study examines the impact of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in-house professional development trainings based on Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge in-Action (TPACK-In-Action) model on female teachers' pedagogy at a Saudi Arabian university. Data were collected using survey questionnaires to gather participants' pre-workshops and post-workshops responses followed by semi-structured interviews to understand aspects that determined the effect of the training workshops on teachers' pedagogy. The findings show that despite having sound pedagogy and teaching qualifications, participants could not successfully utilize their skills to incorporate technology effectively in their teaching. Institutional policies regarding technology integration and complex pacing guide which directed learning objectives and course materials could not give teachers the freedom to integrate learned skills in class, thus, the trainings provided to them became ineffective. The findings of the study suggest arranging training workshops according to the needs of the teachers who want to integrate technology in teaching. The study also recommends that an informed institutional policy regarding the use of technology is important which will ultimately result in effectiveness of the training workshops. Such decisions should be taken in accordance with the teaching syllabus and its pacing guide, and technology integration should be prescribed as a part of syllabus.\",\n",

       " 'Purpose: The purpose of this report is to elevate the collective understanding of what it means to be and become a TESOL professional and what differentiates &quot;TESOLers&quot; from other teachers. We have intentionally prepared this report as an Open Educational Resource (OER), so it can be freely shared with an international audience. Methods: This report synthesizes literature relating to signature pedagogies, teacher training, and educational technology. Results: We explore the surface, deep, and implicit structures of three signature pedagogies of TESOL teacher education: (a) developing the TESOL knowledge base; (b) cultivating reflective practice; (c) engaging in a TESOL practicum. We also situate TESOL within a technology, content, and pedagogical content (TPACK) framework as a means to further understand how and why TESOL teacher education can and should incorporate technology in a variety of ways. Implications: TESOL is a relatively young discipline and has come of age during a time when technology has emerged as an essential element of teaching and learning. As such, TESOL teacher education programs must address technology as a key element of teacher preparation for the profession.',\n",

       " \"The role of mobile technology has significantly increased and been emphasized in English education. However, research investigating EFL teachers' attitudes and behaviors related to mobile technology has been limited in descriptive aspects of the technology, leading to misunderstandings about EFL teachers' needs. Furthermore, many prior studies have examined various aspects of electronic learning (e-learning) and technological developments of mobile learning (m-learning) in English education from the learners' perspective. Therefore, this study proposed a research model that empirically examines behaviors of EFL teacher's' m-learning acceptance by using Fred Davis's Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the research framework. As external variables, this research model includes instant connectivity, compatibility, interaction, content enrichment, and computer self-efficacy, influencing the perceived usefulness of TAM. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with the data of 189 EFL teachers was used to analyze causal relationships between external variables and TAM variables. The results provide evidence that supports the tested hypotheses. The implications of the findings suggest a new direction for future studies on m-learning.\",\n",
       " \"The present study aimed to investigate the challenges and barriers encountered by ESL teachers when they implement technological tools in writing classroom. It also explored teachers' perceptions towards integrating technology in writing classroom. The study involved observing a number of writing classes from different levels at an English Language Institute at a southwestern university in the United States. Next, an interview was conducted with one of the observed teachers to enquire about implementing technology in the classroom and reasons behind possible challenges. The study revealed some challenges that hindered or prevented teachers from applying technology in writing classroom. Such challenges were technical problems, students' attitudes towards using technology, lack of time, lack of computers and other devices, and lack of technical support. Moreover, the study showed that teachers had positive perceptions toward using technology to facilitate teaching process. Pedagogical implications and solutions to overcome technical issues are provided for ESL/EFL writing teachers and policy makers.\",\n",

       " 'Researchers over the past years have proven the positive effects of using information and communication technology in learning. This research work considers the digital nature of modern students associated with educational technologies and their importance in learning English through the medium best known to modern students. A review of related literature with a sole purpose of measuring the recent research trends on the contributions of innovative technology towards English language learning and teaching. To measure the trends on technology contributions in English teaching, quantitative content analysis method was employed for the purpose of this research where fifty academic articles published between the years 2000-2018 were considered for being relevant and available with full text open access and written in English language. Twenty-six of which from EBSCO and twenty four from Science Direct Database, under the title of social sciences: Teaching of English by innovative technology, obtained from the Near East University library, online resources, serve as the source of data collection. SPSS software will be the data analysis tool.',\n",
       " 'Machine translation, specifically Google Translate, is freely available, and is improving in its ability to provide grammatically accurate translations. This development has the potential to provoke a major transformation in the internationalization process at universities, since students may be, in the future, able to use technology to circumvent traditional language learning processes. While this is a potentially empowering move that may facilitate academic exchange and the diversification of the learner and researcher community, it is also a potentially problematic issue in two main respects. Firstly, the technology is at present unable to align to the sociolinguistic aspects of university-level writing and may be misunderstood as a remedy to lack of writer language proficiency. Secondly, it introduces a new dimension to the production of academic work that may clash with Higher Education policy and, thus, requires legislation, in particular in light of issues such as plagiarism and academic misconduct. This paper considers these issues against the background of English as a Global Lingua Franca, and argues two points. First of these is that Higher Education Institutions need to develop an understanding and code of practice for the use of this technology. Secondly, potential future research will be presented.',\n",
       " \"The purpose of this study is to investigate the student teachers' use of technology in their classrooms during practice teaching experience. To this end, a questionnaire was given to 86 student teachers completing their teaching practicum at Anadolu University English Language Teaching Program. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with 12 of the participants for data triangulation. The analyses of the quantitative and qualitative data indicated that the practicum schools were not very rich in terms of the technological devices available to the student teachers for their EFL classes. It was also discovered that student teachers were not benefiting from technology available to them in their teaching practice at a satisfying level. Insufficient training, lack of basic facilities in the practicum schools, and student teachers' own choices were found the main reasons for student teachers to utilize technology in the teaching practice process. The findings of the study revealed a mismatch between teacher training programs and real-world classrooms in terms of technology integration in EFL instruction. Pedagogical implications of the study consist of the need for better integration of technology in EFL teacher training and a stronger link between the placement schools and the university.\",\n",

       " \"The present study explores high school students' (aged 16-17) attitudes towards the use of technology Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the English as foreign language (EFL) classroom. While digital competence has become one of the core skills in our society, ICT is gaining more presence in the EFL teaching and learning. However, it is not widespread in the mainstream education, as it is the case of Spain, especially at high school level. There is also still some reticence on the part of the teachers to let the ICT be part and parcel of their daily practice. Since adolescents often experience a motivational drop as far as learning a foreign language (FL) in school setting is concerned, EFL teachers should promote the integration of ICT in classroom activities, as research has shown that technology-supported activities may contribute to engaging students in the process of learning a FL and act as a motivating factor. This paper examines 77 EFL learners' responses to a questionnaire administered before and after the implementation of an 18-month ICT-based intervention in their classroom. The main findings reveal that attitudes towards technology were positive and they were maintained beyond the possible &quot;novelty effect&quot;, which supports the claims in favor of ICT's integration in EFL teaching.\",\n",
       " \"This meta-analysis reviewed research between 2012 and 2018 focused on technology-assisted second language (L2) vocabulary learning for English as a foreign language (EFL) learner. A total of 45 studies of 2,374 preschool-to-college EFL students contributed effect sizes to this meta-analysis. Compared with traditional instructional methods, the overall effect of technology-assisted L2 vocabulary learning was large (g = 0.845), suggesting that technology-assisted L2 vocabulary learning was more beneficial than non-technology-assisted instruction. Importantly, within-study comparison results indicated that technology could enhance learners' long-term vocabulary retention. Moderator analysis results highlight several variables--namely, device type, game condition, setting, test format, and reported reliability--affecting the effectiveness of vocabulary learning. Specifically, advantages were found for mobile devices and on-the-move learning, suggesting that L2 vocabulary learning may be most efficient when students use mobile phones and are not restricted by classroom settings. These variables should be considered when planning instruction in technology-assisted L2 vocabulary learning.\",\n",

       " \"This large scale study investigated the influences that technology-related policies and teachers' constructivist teaching beliefs have on their intention to use technology in Chinese universities. Data were collected from 696 English teachers working in 59 Chinese universities. Five variables (subjective norm, constructivist teaching belief, perceived importance of policy, computer self-efficacy and voluntariness) were examined in this study. Results indicated that perceived importance of policy, constructivist teaching beliefs and subjective norm were significant antecedents of perceived usefulness. The relationship between subjective norm and teachers' intentions to use technology was moderated by voluntariness. Besides perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use also had significantly influenced English teachers' behavioural intention. Overall, the research model explained 69% of variance of teachers' intentions to use technology. This study has the potential to enrich our understanding of technology acceptance in teaching by contextualising the study in the rarely researched English teaching context in Chinese universities. The findings from this study also provide suggestions for policy makers and teacher educators.\",\n",

This paper discusses the impacts this staff professional development model. The model was used to train 18 teachers to effectively use and integrate technology in their ESL classrooms in ways that improved learning for students, especially ESL students in economically disadvantaged, low performing, and high need schools. The year-long training, which took place in the Piedmont Triad area of North Carolina, was part of a state-funded grant initiative aimed at improving performances of teachers in &quot;high need&quot; and/or economically disadvantaged schools in the state of North Carolina in support of the federal &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; mandates. The teachers were drawn from two school system classified that met the state's classification as &quot;high need and/or &quot;economically disadvantaged schools.&quot; Baseline data were collected via product rubrics; observations; analysis of end products and their use and application in the classroom; structured interviews from participants and their building principals. In addition, pre and post surveys using Technology Integration Survey were conducted to determine the teachers' technology integration skills. Participants' pre and post-ratings on the survey were based on a Likert-type scale of 1 to 5, with 1- lowest and 5-highest. Posttest ratings were moderately higher than pre-ratings for most of the skills/areas surveyed. Findings from observations and interviews with the participants and their building principal also indicated that they developed improved skills, abilities, interest and confidence in using and integrating technology in the classroom more effectively than they did prior to participating in the professional development. Based on experiences and preliminary findings from implementing the product-based model of staff professional dded that technology professional development designers and implementers should review all materials to determine the merits of grouping participants by level of proficiency. Likewise, timing and duration of the professional/workshop should be based on preassessment feedback. The mix of individual and group assignments should be carefully examined to ensure the efficient coverage of certain topics in the appropriate timeframe; attention should be paid to different learning styles. Appended are: (1) Project goal, objectives, outcomes, and assessment measures relating to technology integration; and (2) Technology Integration Survey. (Contains 2 tables.)\",\n",
       " \"While gamified technology integration in vocabulary instruction within a flipped classroom has yielded beneficial teaching outcomes, specific studies have raised concerns about potential adverse effects linked to this approach. As a result, conducting a comparative analysis between gamified technology and conventional paper-based methods within the flipped classroom framework has become essential. This analysis aims to foster the development of a targeted teaching approach that adeptly addresses the unique needs of students. This study employed a sequential explanatory research design to examine the effectiveness of flipped classroom with gamified technology and paper-based method in teaching vocabulary to students with different proficiency levels. Quantitative data was gathered from a pretest and a posttest, whilst qualitative data was collected through teachers' guided reflection. Using Academic Word List (300 target words), control groups employed a paper-based, while experimental groups applied gamified technology (&quot;Quizlet,&quot; &quot;Kahoot!,&quot; &quot;Quizizz,&quot; &quot;Socrative,&quot; and &quot;Google Form&quot;), which lasted 10\\xa0weeks. The participants were 144 non-English major students who took a general English course in the 2nd semester of 2023. Quantitative data analysis ran in SPSS 25 using &quot;Paired Sample t-Test&quot; and &quot;One-way ANOVA.&quot; The qualitative data were analyzed using thematic progression. The results showed that gamified technology did not affect students' learning outcomes, while the paper-based method resulted conversely. It revealed that the paper-based method is more effective than gamified technology for students in general, with low proficiency and high-proficiency level. Further, teachers' beliefs admitted distinctive issues that gamified technology was more effective for high-proficiency learners, whereas paper-based was more effective for low-proficiency learners. The difference analysis of quantitative and qualitative data sheds light on discussing threats while implementing gamified technology and possible solutions.\",\n",
       " 'When it comes to language learning, vocabulary learning is the main activity focused on. Vocabulary learning is the main problem and also the goal of new language learners. It is one of the major problems that language learners encounter during learning a new language. Krashen (1989) (cited in Tokac, 2005) points out the role of vocabulary in a language by stating that most of the meaning in a language is carried by words. This is why people visiting a foreign country prefer to take their dictionaries with them rather than grammar books. And on the other hand, nowadays everything is connected to technology and language learning and teaching is not an exception. As Stockwell (2007) cites, vocabulary has been one of the most commonly taught language areas through technology in recent years. Integration of computer and second/foreign language teaching is admired by many researchers. It is clear that technology can help enhance the degree of vocabulary learning, but the point is that which computer assisted vocabulary learning can work better and would be more efficient? In this paper we will discuss and analyze the usage of two kinds of different ways of using technology and see which of the methods will work better. A comparison between vocabulary software flashcard and word clouds (Wordle) on vocabulary learning (retention) will be compared by the researcher. We will see that using which method will encourage learners more and they will do better with which kind of using technology? The study is carried out in Iran on 44 English learners. The result is really surprising. Both of the groups were interested in technology, but one group did really better.',\n",

This study investigated the impact of this sudden change on EFL learners' perceptions of assessment in a technology-enhanced learning environment. Assessment dimensions such as affective factors, validity, reliability, practicality, security and pedagogy were explored through an online questionnaire administered among 345 Iranian EFL learners and a focus-group interview with 17 learners. In addition, through a quasi-experimental design, the study compared the learners' academic achievements of online and in-person classrooms during the COVID-19 outbreak. The findings revealed that the flexibility of online assessment, immediate feedback and encouraging self-regulated learning are among the advantages and technical problems, technology dependence and technology literacy are among the challenges of technology-enhanced assessment. The findings indicated that while technology-enhanced assessment has a positive impact on learners' performances, learners have various attitudes towards e-assessment that need to be addressed in future studies.\",\n",
       " \"Purpose: This paper aims to highlight a research on integrating technology into teaching and learning of second/foreign language writing. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 18 empirical studies, involving a total of 1,281 second and foreign language learners, have been reviewed. These studies are selected from the following two databases: Web of Science and Google Scholar. The meta-analysis investigates how effect sizes vary depending on these moderators as follows: stage of writing, language context, learners' educational level and language proficiency level. Findings: The findings of this meta-analysis have indicated that technology has a large effect on second/foreign language writing (d = 1.7217). These findings have also revealed that the two stages of writing, drafting and editing, have received most of the researchers' concern. In addition, high school and university learners have achieved a larger effect size of using technology in writing learning; beginner learners have achieved the smallest effect size. Originality/value: To sum, the previous meta-analyses and reviews tried to explore the effect of computer on writing skills. However, some of them were limited to special groups (Williams and Beam, 2019) and some others analyzed very few studies (Little et al., 2018). Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the effect of implementing technology in writing skills is needed. The purpose of this study is to perform a meta-analysis of the primary studies about the integration of technology into writing skills. The primary goals of this meta-analysis were to: examine the overall effects of implementing technology in writing; synthesize the relationship between technology and a number of moderators such as stages of writing, language context, learners' target language proficiency and learners' educational level (school and university).\",\n",

First, we aimed to compile a profile of language learners' technological acumen, access to and ownership of technology, and the current uses of technology across a wide range of languages being studied. Second, we wanted to investigate whether learners, when grouped by language of study (commonly taught or less-commonly taught), differed in their knowledge, ownership, or uses of technology. Third, we wanted to relate these data to the learners' receptiveness to a proposed increase in the amount of technology used for language instruction. Significant differences in the variables were found in terms of level of academic study and the classification of the language being learned (commonly taught versus less-commonly taught and Roman alphabet versus non-Roman alphabet). These differences reflect the recent discussions on the preparedness of students for increases in computer-assisted language learning and hybrid and distance language classes.

Hence, providing emotional support for teachers who are willing to adopt ICT in language instruction is an issue worthy of attention. In order to promote ICT-supported language instruction, this study aims to identify the contexts and types of emotions experienced by teachers. Teachers in universities of technology were invited to participate in this study in order to share their experiences and emotions in applying ICT in language courses. We address the following research questions: 1) What are the current practices of ICT by language teachers in higher education? 2) What emotions are involved in the integration of ICT into language courses? Questionnaires and interviews were adopted to collect relevant data. The results showed that teachers have positive attitudes toward integrating ICT integration but a gap exists between the extent to which teachers enjoy using technology and the degree to which they use the technology in their classes. Regarding the emotions expressed by teachers, most were happy with their utilization of ICT. However, negative emotions experienced are anxiety, anger, and sadness.

       " \"Although technology is a vital part of 21st-century education, teachers in English as a foreign language (EFL) contexts face challenges when using digital tools in their teaching. Studies have been conducted with in-service teachers to understand their beliefs and practices with digital learning of English. However, there is a gap in the literature about investigating the technology integration beliefs and practices of newly graduated EFL teachers who experienced online teaching practice during their pre-service education. Thus, this study aimed to investigate how novice teachers' online practicum affects their teaching with technology in face-to-face classrooms. To this end, this study adopted a qualitative case study research design and collected data through six open-ended questions from 20 Turkish novice EFL teachers who received their teaching practice and school experience courses online and conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 participants. The thematic analysis of the data showed that the participants were aware of the importance of technology use, and their online teaching practice experience helped them get familiar with teaching English with digital tools before graduating. However, the lack of resources and support in their current face-to-face teaching contexts prevented them from using technology. The findings revealed that teacher education programs should offer updated content and opportunities for creating digital material to prepare EFL teachers for the future.\",\n",

SR technology has been used in various language learning contexts. Its application to EFL teaching and learning is still relatively recent, but a solid understanding of its effectiveness for EFL learning is important because SR-based programs are now available online and easily accessible to many EFL learners worldwide. In this study, an online reading program featuring SR technology has been used as supplementary materials for a group of EFL elementary school students to maintain their interest as well as to advance in English learning. The researcher examined and analyzed the students' performance from the tracking system. Field observations and interviews with both children and the EFL teacher were also conducted to understand how they responded to the feedback provided by the program and their perceived affordance of SR technology for their learning.\",\n",

The present qualitative study is an intervention, which attempted to explore the integration of technology among 11 public school English language teachers in the Sultanate of Oman through the use of community of practice (CoP). As the first in the region, this qualitative study triangulated data using a focus group interview and reflective journals. Three themes emerged from the data analysis. Despite certain challenges, the findings were generally positive and encouraging, and revealed that if a CoP is effectively utilized to the fullest to integrate technology in ELT, it can facilitate policy implementation and Second Language Teacher Education (SLTE) in the Sultanate of Oman, the neighboring Gulf Cooperation Council countries, some Asian and Far Eastern countries, and beyond.\",\n",
       " 'The Saudi education system is facing a climate of change characterized by an interest in integrating new technology and educational approaches to improve teaching and learning. In this climate, the present paper explores the issues in integrating information technology in learning and teaching English as a foreign language (EFL) in government intermediate schools in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. The background to information technology use in Saudi education is introduced, with specific reference to the &quot;Watani&quot; project for integrating computer and internet use into educational administration and teaching. Taking an interpretive approach, the author offers insights into the current status and use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) facilities in the two intermediate schools. A discrepancy is found between intention and practice. Issues are highlighted that contribute to the failure to exploit fully the potential of ICT: teacher resistance, lack of training and budgetary or resource constraints. The author concludes that the wider exploitation of information technology in learning English, supported by appropriate training, could benefit both students and teachers and offers recommendations for its implementation.',\n",

Considering basic and sub-skills in English, vocabulary is probably the most preferred skill to learn by using different technological tools and applications. The present study, therefore, sought to investigate whether technology had an impact on L2 vocabulary development in a positive way by raising the awareness of learners in terms of using technology for educational purposes. A quasi-experimental research design was preferred. The data was obtained through creative writing assignments and an achievement test. 48 prep-class students took part in this study. The results revealed that although learners in the experimental group outperformed, the scores of creative writing assignments and achievement tests belonging to two groups were statistically non-significant. Setting out from these findings, some practical and pedagogical suggestions were provided.\",\n",

To this end, data were collected from 209 Iranian EFL teachers. The results from conducting a series of Pearson correlations indicated a significant association between teachers' TPACK and attitude and their technology use. Moreover, a significant relationship was found between school climate and teachers' attitudes. Considering direct and indirect relations, structural equation modeling was employed so as to examine the relationship among the variables (i.e., school climate, TPACK, attitude, and technology integration). The results of this phase indicated that TPACK and attitude significantly predict technology integration. Considering the indirect path coefficients, it was confirmed that school climate predicts technology integration mediated by teachers' attitude. The findings are discussed in light of the available literature and suggestions are provided for further research.\",\n",

The mixed method, in which qualitative and quantitative research designs were used together, was used in the study. The data of the research was collected using data collection tools including scale and open-ended questions. The research covers English Language Teachers working in Aksaray province in the 2020-2021 academic year. The sample of the study consists of 303 English Language Teachers working in primary, secondary and high schools in Aksaray. Teachers' technology self-efficacy assessment capacities were determined by taking their opinions with the help of Technology Competence Self-Evaluation scale. It was tried to determine teachers' technology use capacities, the problems they face and solution offers by means of open-ended questions prepared by the researcher. The data gathered was analysed through t-tests and one-way Anova via SPSS programme and the opinions obtained from open-ended questions were analyzed through content analysis. As a result of research, it was found that Technological Competency Self-evaluation Levels of English Language Teachers is high and their self-efficacy does not make a significant difference in terms of professional seniority, teachers' levels of academic work, going to technology course and using platforms like eTwinning, web 2.0. It was determined that teachers used technology as Education and Training environment, they used it on the purpose of assessment and evaluation at the lowest level, the teachers who have higher professional seniority have much more difficulties. It was also determined that they face the problems such as infrastructure, internet access problems and illiteracy. It was confirmed that teachers should take in-service training courses as a solution.\",\n",
       " \"In the era of developing technology, especially the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the field of education is witnessing heavy implementation of emerging technologies for teaching and learning, including applications, software, and online courses. However, any piece of technology would bring both advantages and drawbacks. Therefore, blended learning has caught the attention and consideration of all the people involved. This study investigated the impacts of blended learning on writing skills for university students, aiming to figure out the effectiveness and students' attitude towards this study mode. Fifty-six pre-intermediate students with little or no formal instructions on how to utilize technology in learning essay writing were selected. A combination of experimental design and questionnaires was used, giving the treatment participants alternative learning experiences through a variety of technology applications beside the traditional method. Data from pre-tests and post-tests taken from the eight-week period revealed that students in the experimental groups outperformed those in the control group on the aspects of topic development, essay organization, and lexical usage. Results of the questionnaires delivered at the end of the course showed very positive feedback towards this blended mode in terms of effectiveness, involvement and collaboration. Yet, some drawbacks reported by the participants were worth our mindfulness and consideration when applying this model in a larger scale.\",\n",
       " \"Digital education with mobile technology is becoming a global trend. This study considers language teachers' challenges related to open distance teaching in higher education. Twenty-eight university lecturers participated in the semi-structured interviews and expressed their opinions on how mobile technologies impacted the nature of teaching and learning in tertiary education. In particular, four themes associated with teaching English in the context of mobile technologies were discussed: (1) technology mediation, (2) disruptive pedagogy, (3) English teaching, and (4) learning flexibility. The results show that mobile technology and pedagogical innovation are not challenging for teachers. Instead, psychological anxiety, extended pedagogical roles, and learning flexibility are the challenging issues. Based on the results, a theoretical framework for digital education and a learning model for digital native students are proposed. This study suggests further work to promote pedagogy that connects students with higher-level thinking.\",\n",

       " \"This study aimed at bringing administrators, teachers and students into the conversation of integrating TELL. By exploring their understanding and beliefs about using technology and by also making a connection to their actual practices, the study shed a light on the importance of considering all three groups into the planning and use of technology to enhance language learning. This study explored three different areas in relation to technology-enhanced English language learning within a Saudi EFL tertiary context. These three different areas included: The current state of technology use at this Saudi EFL Tertiary context; administrators,' teachers,' and students' expectations of using technology compared to their actual use; and how teachers, administrators, and students were supported/provided support to meet these expectations. A single-case exploratory qualitative design was used utilizing interviews, document analysis, and classroom and site observations. A class of intermediate level students was observed and interviewed, along with the group teachers, and the English language program administrators over a period of two months. Six students, five teachers, and two administrators participated in the study. Findings pointed to a gap that existed between expectations and actual use of technology due to many factors as discussed in the study. One of the main issues for this was the absence of considering other stakeholders when planning, supporting, training, or using technology. There needs to be a comprehensive understanding of how TELL is used by considering all involved parties in the teaching, and learning of a language. This is first achieved by involving administrators, teachers, and students into the conversation about the planning and use of TELL. We cannot look at only one of these constituents in isolation, without considering all of them as they all play a role in the successful integration of technology into the learning and teaching of English. Even when considering all constituents, which is largely ignored in the field, other factors come into play as this study reveals. These include issues of power, dominant teacher methodologies, financial constraints, the power of self-learning over institutional learning, institutional administrators as a fourth dimension, and other factors within and beyond the institution.

       " \"One of the crucial issues for successful technology-enhanced out-of-class language learning (OCLL) is the learners' continuance intention to use technology. Considering the strong mutual relationship between learners' intention and motivation, the present study extended the technology acceptance model (TAM) with the self-determination theory (SDT) to investigate Japanese EFL learners' intention to use learning technologies for OCLL. The study was conducted in a technology-enhanced OCLL environment using a web-based e-portfolio system. The hypothesised model included two principal antecedents of behavioural intention introduced by TAM--perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use--in addition to the three psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness introduced by SDT. Path analysis was conducted to find the multivariate relationships between the constructs in the model based on the collected data from 162 Japanese EFL learners. The results indicated that SDT determinants could significantly predict perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, among which perceived competence was the most influential factor. Furthermore, perceived usefulness highly influenced the learners' intention to continue technology-enhanced OCLL, which in turn influenced their actual usage of the system.\",\n",
       " \"Assessment and technology are two components that are very important in education. Assessment is the core of education, which provides teachers much information from their students and technology helps to achieve the learning goal more easily. Teachers are able to take the advantages of the integration of technology and assessment to get really detail information of students test to create a good teaching process. However, there are not many teachers, who really consider about assessment and the washback effect on students' learning. Thus, this study aimed to explore the washback effect of Quizizz assessment platform on students' learning. To investigate the issue, the researcher used questionnaire, observation and in-depth interviews. The data obtained would be analyzed qualitatively. The result of the study shows that students were motivated and they wanted to learn more deeply after doing several gamified test with Quizizz. They were interested in elements of game such as Leaderboard, Meme, Time restriction, and Test report.\",\n",
       " \"Purpose: This study aims to explore the use of technology-based strategies by Yemeni undergraduate students to develop their English as a foreign language skills in informal learning settings. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed methods research design was used to collect quantitative and qualitative data from 110 undergraduate students enrolled at the English Departments in two universities in Yemen. In the first phase of the study, 10 students were interviewed to obtain information about their use of technology to develop their English language skills and subsystems in informal settings. Following the analysis of the interview data, a questionnaire was built to collect quantitative data, and the second phase of the study was carried out with 100 undergraduate students. Findings: The findings revealed that students developed four technology-based strategies that they used in informal settings. These strategies included using social media, being inspired by someone, accessing social networks and websites. Students reported that these strategies helped them develop their listening, speaking and reading skills, while they also reported that their vocabulary was enhanced over grammar and pronunciation. Research limitations/implications: The study findings can be of benefit not only for helping to raise students' awareness of informal learning strategies to develop their English skills outside the classroom but also for teachers to rethink the importance of integrating technology tools and digital resources in their teaching practice. The results could also guide curriculum designers to augment textbook materials by integrating technology-based informal learning strategies. Originality/value: This is the first study on this topic conducted in the context of higher education in Yemen and offers unique insights into informal learning practices of Yemeni students. In addition, the findings of the study open new dimensions for rethinking the classification of language learning strategies to include those that are technology-based and mainly useful for independent informal learning.\",\n",
       " \"This qualitative research explored the issues and challenges in teaching English as Foreign Language (EFL) in Gorontalo, Indonesia, from two main cases. First is the implementation of the &quot;Kurikulum Tingkat Satuan Pendidikan&quot; (&quot;KTSP&quot;) in EFL Instructions; second is the integration of technology in EFL instruction.    This research utilized interviews, observations, and document analysis as the instruments in data collection. The participants consisted of four EFL teachers, three EFL faculty members, and two administrators, representing four schools, one university, and one college in Gorontalo City, where this research was conducted.    In the case of the implementation of KTSP in EFL instruction, findings indicate that EFL teachers in Gorontalo face challenges in implementing KTSP due to lack of understanding about the new curriculum. Their challenges are exacerbated by the limited access to the educational facilities in Gorontalo, which are a consequence of the unequal spread of development in Indonesia. Professional development training workshops that focus on increasing the teachers' knowledge and increasing the supervising functions are recommended to help minimize those challenges.    Regarding the case of the integration of technology in EFL teaching, findings indicate that the availability of technology was not the only challenge in integrating technology in EFL instruction. Preparing teachers to understand how to use the technology in EFL teaching was also one of the challenges they faced. Therefore, in addition to providing more appropriate technology in the classroom, it is also highly recommended that the teachers be given the technical training and professional development to implement new technology in EFL Instruction.

In particular, there has been an increasing number of naturalistic, classroom-based studies, which have demonstrated the affordances of TBLT in particular contexts, but whose findings may be less generalizable. Against this backdrop, a qualitative research synthesis of these classroom-based studies is warranted. The current study adopts grounded theory (GT) as the methodology to systematically synthesize qualitative findings from 16 technology-mediated TBLT studies published between 2002 and 2017 in second and foreign language contexts. This resulted in the identification of (a) the characteristics of technology-mediated TBLT, (b) the affordances and limitations of technology-mediated TBLT, and (c) the factors affecting the effectiveness of technology-mediated TBLT. Following this synthesis, a possible research agenda is proposed and practical implications are suggested.',\n",

With the growth and dissemination of this technology, there is a massive opportunity for teachers to add this technology to their methods of teaching a second/foreign language, since students keep showing a growing interest in new technologies. This systematic review of empirical research aims at understanding whether the use of gaming strategies in virtual reality is beneficial for the learning of a second/foreign language or not. Results show that more than half of the articles proved that virtual reality technologies with gaming strategies can be used to learn a foreign language. It was also found that &quot;learning&quot; was the most evaluated dependent variable among the chosen records, augmented reality was the leading technology used, primary education and lower secondary was the most researched school stages, and the most used language to evaluate the use of gamified technology was by far the English language. Given the lack of directed investigation, it is recommended to use these technologies to support second language learning and not entirely replace traditional approaches.

       " \"The present paper details the experience of designing and running the first online English language courses at Yarmouk University with the support of the Open University of Catalonia. The courses fall within the framework of the EQTEL project, which aims to develop and implement accreditation standards, guidelines and procedures for quality assurance of online courses in Jordanian universities. The focus of the research was to evaluate the course from the teachers' perspective while identifying possible stumbling blocks and challenges that could be used to refine and enhance the course and the teacher preparation program in successive iterations. Teachers completed a questionnaire that sought to reveal their beliefs, attitudes and experiences using technology for language instruction. The study concluded that teachers perceive more affordances in using technology to practice receptive skills (listening, reading) than productive skills (speaking, writing). Teachers evaluated the teacher preparation prior to the course as sufficient but expressed contradictory attitudes towards using technology for language instruction which need to be understood within the context of the institutional culture and the decision-making process behind technology adoption.\",\n",
       " \"With the rapid penetration of technology in the lives of students, it has become important for educators to look for opportunities to enhance students' engagement and achievement by integrating technology in education. However, deciding which technologies should be included is a big challenge for higher education institutes, particularly in developing countries with limited financial resources, such as Pakistan. As students' non-educational use of technologies shapes their academic use of technology and learning process (Swanson &amp; Walker, 2015), integrating students' preferred technologies can help fulfil their educational needs and expectations. This paper investigates the digital practices of undergraduate students in a public university in Pakistan and examines the impact of gender, study major and medium of education on the use of digital devices by students. The data is drawn from 316 responses to an online survey, administered online. The results of the study reveal that although a substantial proportion of the students had access to digital tools such as smartphones and computers, there was limited use of them for educational purposes. The technology most extensively accessed by undergraduate students for this purpose was mobile phones.

       " \"This paper reports the results of a qualitative study focusing on the ways in which technological tools are implemented in mathematics education in a Title I K-5 school. Specifically, the intent was to understand the perspectives and actions of the school's mathematics specialist and the multi-graded 2nd and 3rd-grade classroom teacher as they attempted to deliver instruction with technology for both English-as-a-Second Language (ESL) and non-ESL students. Results of the study have implications for school policy and practice regarding the role of English in the use of technology for the education of recently arrived non-English speaking children. The most important implication is that the classroom teacher/instructional technologist must take into account the role of language  when designing and delivering mathematics instruction and technology to such students by ensuring students understand the academic instructions that are used in combination with the notational systems, and that the emphasis in discourse is that of &quot;communication,&quot; instead of &quot;verbal English.&quot; (Contains 18 references.)

       " 'Previous studies conducted by researchers show that technology utilization in the ESL classroom indeed aids students in the learning process (Snelbecker 1999). Furthermore, it also ensures that students achieve better results in English Language. Thus, this study was conducted as a stepping stone to help teachers perform better in utilizing technology in the ESL classrooms. This effort will then improve the standards of English in secondary classrooms as they are moving ahead to tertiary level and leading to career pathway where they will apply both theoretical and practical values, (Winkellmann and Meskill 1995). Therefore, utilization of computer advancement in the ESL secondary classrooms has become an important tool to enhance effective teaching and learning in the ESL classroom. Thus it has led to a survey being conducted among 70 samples chosen by the researcher through random sampling among the large population of ESL teachers in Klang Valley, Malaysia. A structured questionnaire was used as an investigation tool to obtain data from the samples. About 70 questionnaires were distributed to the respondents in selected schools in Kuala Lumpur. The questionnaires were self-administered and collected personally by the researcher. Prior to that, a one to one interview session also was conducted once the respondents have finished filling the questionnaire. The raw data obtained through the questionnaire was coded, analyzed and calculated using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, SPSS version 17. The interview data collected were transcribed and analyzed in order to triangulate the results of the findings obtained. The findings revealed that foundation awareness on what is expected by these teachers regarding technology use in the ESL secondary classrooms. It has been found that some school teachers were forced to use technology in the classroom without giving them some quality time to learn and acquire it in order for them to have a passion to learn how to utilize and apply it without fail and more confidently in their ESL classroom. This study was conducted as an initial effort to help teachers perform the best in utilizing technology in the ESL classrooms rather than neglecting their feelings, needs and effort in blindly trying to compete with the rapid movement of technology in education in this era.',\n",

Moreover, among many academic organizations, the Polish educational system is one in which many limitations and challenges have been appearing. Thus, the contribution of the present work is to examine the avenues and experiences that are significant on the way to implement new technology and which need improvement from the EFL teachers' perspectives in this new context. Overall, 180 EFL Polish teachers participated in the exploratory survey study, which explored their (un)readiness, capacities, support, efficacy, and obstacles in technology integration. Respondents' perceptions enable thoughts, further implications, and recommendations on a more instructive, interactional, and rewarding approach that could be implemented while integrating EFL teaching with a technology-based mode of lesson delivery. It was discovered that not only teachers may establish better EFL remote practices, but also -- all the language education policy stakeholders.\",\n",
       " 'Among a variety of language learning materials, the crucial role that coursebooks have on learning and teaching processes takes a great deal of attention in the scholarly literature. English language coursebooks have been thought of as one of the most pivotal instruments for effective and systematic language learning experiences. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to address the issue of developing English language coursebooks that meet current requirements of the 21st century. This study aims to explore the extent of technological affordances in English coursebooks used in upper secondary schools in Türkiye. To achieve this aim, a qualitative methodology based on content analysis has been taken as a methodological approach. In this regard, an evaluation checklist for technology integration has been developed and used in the study. Data were collected investigating the content of the two coursebooks from the 9th grade and 10th grade used in Türkiye. Overall, the findings substantiate that despite some notable attempts to integrate technology into current coursebooks, further work is required to develop a well-designed and systematic standard for technological affordances in the content of current coursebooks. The findings provide several insights and implications for developing technology-integrated coursebooks, thus promoting technology-enhanced teaching and learning practices.',\n",
       " \"In this era of technology, teachers need to adapt to changes in their profession, and learn faster than before. They don't want to be restricted to their isolated classrooms and schools but continue learning anywhere, anytime. When a teacher attends conferences, joins teaching communities and discusses new techniques and innovations with colleagues, that means s/he is building a personal learning network (PLN). Face-to-face PLN has been extended to technology-assisted networks lately, as technology has led to new ways of learning and socializing. Teaching is not a solitary act, and teachers need other teachers to be complete. In this respect, social media such as Twitter, Facebook, blogs, are suitable virtual platforms for personal learning. In the literature, very limited research has been conducted regarding PLNs as a whole concept rather than individual digital platforms among English language teachers in Turkey directly. Responding to gap in the literature, this study was conducted through a questionnaire with 302 participants. For open questions, a thematic analysis was done while for closed questions, frequencies and percentages were taken. The findings show that English language teachers in Turkey utilize technology-assisted PLNs as a sharing and learning platform and expand the boundaries of their immediate contacts.\",\n",

Technology is used in three different ways: as a support (video) for analysis through teacher-instructor interaction, as a means of social interaction and use of language for education between teacher and students (use of the computer for instruction), and as the creation of own designed materials for language training (through the use of technology). Data is obtained from video-recordings related to teaching and learning English as a foreign language by three different teachers in three subjects from Primary and Infant Education at Universidad de Alcalá. Results indicate that microteaching is not only valid as a training method but also to introduce new content and concepts that have not been previously introduced in the classes. The interaction in the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) between the teacher-instructor and the teacher-students also proves to have a powerful effect in motivation, teaching improvement and language for education skills development through self-reflection.

In addition, this study revealed how the variables correlated to the lecturers' EFL teaching performances. Therefore, a correlational design with a descriptive explanation model was conducted. The participants were six EFL lecturers from six different universities in various cities in East Java Province, Indonesia. The data were collected by administering TPACK-SAMR DLC and technostress questionnaires, conducting a semi-structured interview, and documenting the teaching scenarios. The results showed that most participants were more confident with their pedagogical knowledge and content knowledge. They claimed it was hard to mingle them into harmonious teaching performances with technology that challenged them to achieve the higher TPACK-SAMR DLC level. Relevant to this finding, their DLC had a negative 'very high' correlation with technostress, shown by -0.824 Pearson correlation coefficient. Henceforth, their EFL teaching performances reflected the minimum operation of technology, according to SAMR stages, to mediate EFL teaching by substituting and augmenting the technology. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of DLC training to escalate the positive outcomes of EFL teaching with technology and minimize technostress.\",\n",

       " 'Newcomers to Canada with low proficiency in English or French often face challenges in the workforce (Kustec, 2012). While language classes provide workplace language training, not all newcomers are able to attend face-to-face classes (Shaffir &amp; Satzewich, 2010), suggesting a need for outside the classroom, occupation-specific language training. The use of technology has been shown to be advantageous for second language (L2) learning (Stockwell, 2007), especially when used outside the classroom (i.e., mobile-assisted language learning), as mobile technology affords learners greater control and flexibility over their own learning (Yang, 2013). This paper reports on a study investigating the development of a blended curriculum for L2 learners employed in customer service. A technology-mediated module was designed and developed within a task-based language teaching framework to provide workplace-linguistic support on mobile devices, enabling learners to access the language instruction they needed, when they needed it. The module contents and usability were assessed by high-beginner English proficiency newcomers employed in customer service (n=4) and their volunteer teachers (n=4). Results confirm the overall benefits of using language learning technology in providing instruction that meets participant language needs, ensuring opportunities for individualized training. Implications for designing, implementing, and researching technology-mediated modules are discussed.',\n",

In the context of English learning, the present study modeled how learners' SES and their perception of technology use for language learning are linked to their motivation for learning English as a foreign language (EFL) and level of English achievement. To this end, 306 South Korean college students' learner factors, motivation, and English achievement were measured. The results of the structural equation modeling analysis indicated that learners' SES was positively associated with their perception of technology use and motivation and indirectly associated with their language learning achievement. Furthermore, we found that learners' perception of technology use in language learning is associated with their motivation and achievement. In addition, among the several learner factors measured in this study, learners' expectancy of being successful in language learning as part of achievement motivation emerged as the strongest predictor of their language learning achievement.

For this purpose, a descriptive survey model was used in this study. The participants of the research consist of 561 English teachers working in institutions (private and state) affiliated to the Ministry of National Education selected from every geographical region of Turkey. Participants work in primary, secondary, and secondary education institutions. Non-random stratified purposive sampling method was used in the sample selection of this study. Personal Information Form and 3 different scales were used for the data collection process of the research. Analysis of the data was performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), t-test, and simple linear regression analysis. As a result of this research, it was seen that there is a positive correlation between English teachers' technology integrating self-efficacy, professional competency, and lifelong learning tendencies. It was determined that teachers' self-efficacy in integrating technology and professional competencies are predictors of their lifelong learning tendencies. In addition, it was observed that there was a significant difference in English teachers' self-efficacy in integrating technology, lifelong learning tendencies, and professional competencies according to gender. English teachers' professional competencies differ according to the type of institution, while their self-efficacy in integrating technology differs according to the type of institution and age. It is thought that the results of this study will contribute to raising awareness about the impact of teachers' self-efficacy and professional development on technology integration on issues surrounding their lifelong learning tendencies.\",\n",

To accomplish this, teachers have to use blended learning strategies such as flipped classroom to enhance learning by blending online and face-to-face settings. However, to apply these strategies teachers have to be prepared and willing to integrate technology. This investigation aimed to determine how teachers' pedagogical, technological, and emotional readiness related to their acceptance and intention to use the flipped classroom methodology for ESL courses in Puerto Rico. Using a descriptive-correlational research design to collect and evaluate quantitative data, the investigator examined the relationship between teacher readiness factors and the determinants of technology acceptance and intention to use technology, in this case flipped learning. The participants of this study were English as second language teachers at the secondary school level (7th to 12th grade) from schools in Puerto Rico. I gathered data an online survey titled Survey of Teachers' Readiness, Acceptance and Use of Technology in Flipped Classrooms. This survey was a modified version of two existing surveys from The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology survey (Venkatesh et al., 2003) and a survey on teacher readiness created by Al-Awidi and Aldhafeeri (2017). A total of 66 teachers from the Puerto Rico public school system answered the survey. The results of this study revealed a relationship between readiness constructs and the predictors of acceptance and intention to use technology, but results were inconclusive regarding the relationship between teacher's readiness and the specific intention to use flipped classroom.

Therefore, in order for instructors to better design courses they should strive to understand how students are using machine translation, as well as student attitudes towards this technology. This present study examined the perspectives of South Korean graduate students at a science and technology university towards the usage of MT in relation to academic settings. This study featured a survey of 100 participants, and found positive correlations between the use of translators on written assignments, important academic work such as theses, as well as a proclivity to use machine translation to support completion of daily academic tasks. Students also showed a strong belief that MT has overall benefits as a language learning tool.

       " \"Results from this study suggest teachers believe technology may provide English language learners (ELLs) an advantage in developing writing skills. Using a theoretical framework by Hadaway, Vardell, and Young (2002) citing seven teacher practices that support the writing of ELL students when writing processes are embedded in real-world activities, this research sought to isolate technology supports within the framework. Practices include: time and opportunity to write, a reason for writing, a genuine audience, access to role models, a safe environment, useful feedback, and a sense of community. Fourteen K-8 classroom teachers reflected on specific classroom events whereby technology was used to support activities in which ELLs wrote within a project-based environment. Using a collective case study approach, the yearlong investigation used qualitative analyses of impressions from the teachers and the professional developer who supported these teachers. The study concluded that the Hadaway, Vardell, and Young (2002) framework could be strengthened by integrating technology. Results suggested that expanding the seven teacher practices to include specific student uses of common technology within each category would be even more beneficial to the development of ELLs' writing skills. In addition to being supportive to teachers of ELLs, these findings may apply to teachers and administrators of other student populations who want to amplify learning opportunities.\",\n",

       " \"The advent of Web 2.0 technology has afforded language educators more useful technology for English as a foreign language (EFL) teaching. This article reviewed 31 empirical studies investigating the employment of web-based technology to enhance EFL learners' speaking performance. The findings indicated that overall, web-based language learning (WBLL) could be classified into five major groups: general websites providing linguistic inputs, blogging platforms, communication tools, project-based learning tools and learning management systems. While the available linguistic input online, e.g. web articles and videos, helped to enhance learners' linguistic and background knowledge, other communication/chat tools facilitated peer interactions and collaborative learning. Audio- and video-based blogging provided convenient platforms for learners to practice their speaking through sharing their personal experiences. Moreover, Web 2.0 technology as a learning management system helped to create a ubiquitous learning environment, where L2 learners could engage in the language learning process without time and space constraints. WBLL was also found to reduce L2 learners' learning anxiety while making them become more active, motivated language learners. In addition, the role of language instructor in web-based technology implementation was also found to be crucial, e.g. monitoring L2 learners' learning progress and providing feedback. Further research, however, is warranted to address existing methodological drawbacks of previous studies by recruiting larger sample size, conducting long-term research and controlling for confounding factors, e.g. prior L2 speaking ability and technology usage experience.\",\n",

Furthermore, this phenomenological study attempted to reveal the factors affecting these two constructs from 20 Indonesian EFL preservice teachers through semi-structured interviews. The findings revealed participants' beliefs that mobile devices could positively contribute to the development of language performance as learning tools and the development of language instruction as instructional tools. Regarding attitudes of EFL preservice teachers toward the use of mobile devices for learning and teaching, this study revealed mixed responses. As learning tools, all participants expressed their positive attitudes toward this technology and intention to use this technology more intensively. As for teaching tools, the majority of the participants expressed their negative attitudes which were reflected in their disappointment through their experience during their student teaching program and their lack of interest to adopt this technology for their future classes. However, they acknowledged that this technology was helpful to facilitate online learning and agreed that this technology would become more popular in the future. Analysis of the data also revealed factors affecting beliefs and attitudes of preservice teachers toward the use of mobile devices as learning and instructional tools comprising perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness and other influencing elements of self-efficacy: enactive mastery, vicarious experience, and physiological arousal. Finally, this study presents implications and recommendations which can be a reference to optimize the integrated mobile technology for class instruction and identifies which aspects in the implementation of mobile technology that require further investigation.

Classroom observation, in-depth interviews and artifact analysis were employed to gather the data on teachers' TPACK praxis and their underlying considerations. The results reveal that the TPACK framework was implemented effectively in reading class as teachers demonstrated their technological, pedagogical and content knowledge. Teachers successfully managed technology-rich learning in the reading classroom supported by the appropriate teaching strategies and the adoption/adaptation of learning content. Some considerations on teachers' TPACK praxis were pinned on understanding the rationality of the actions related to the importance of self-emotional learning, students' diversity and personal development, as well as the practicality of the technology. The finding of the study implies that teachers at more advanced levels present themselves as content creators rather than technology users in technology-infused teaching.\",\n",

       " \"This discussion examines the ever-increasing impact of top-down nation-wide educational reforms on teachers in Japan, exemplified in the 2020 reform. Its unique contribution is a suggestion of an interdisciplinary framework: programming education and English as a foreign language education in elementary schools. Many elementary school teachers are not specialists in computer programming or English education as discipline specialties, yet they face the obligation to teach both subject areas under the authority of the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology. Their lack of training in these curricular areas creates a high level of anxiety as they initially perceived daunting new challenges in their work performances. Concerning programming education, many teachers are not even digital natives, working in schools where &quot;IT rooms [are] covered with dust&quot;. The research highlighted here resulted from the authors' engagement in professional development workshops for teachers, &quot;Integrated Programming English Education,&quot; demonstrating how much these two disciplines share commonalities and how teachers can effectively use them in their daily teaching. The study results reveal how interdisciplinary frameworks can disrupt deficit norms in teaching single-disciplinary subjects overly used in Japanese education, and simultaneously increase teacher agency through the connectivity of programming and English language education.\",\n",

       " \"The impetus for this study was the need to provide effective training for English teachers on the use of Google Drive-related apps at a Japanese school. This training was necessary as the school embarked on creating a Japanese government-required information and communications technology (ICT) educational environment at the school. To address this situation, a professional development (PD) experience was designed for the teachers at the school. This involved a 12-week lesson study cycle with weekly planning meetings, and 5 sessions of technology classes focused on Google Drive apps. The design and evaluation of the PD incorporated adult learning theory, literature on traditional Japanese PD, non-native language speaker research, literature on barriers to technology integration, research on educational technology PD, instructional systems design, and theory on appropriate PD evaluation. This study examined the design, development, implementation, and evaluation of the technology-based PD experience. This study used qualitative methods for collecting and analyzing data, within a designed framework based on Guskey's Five Levels of PD Evaluation (2000), to assess the effects of the professional development on the participants. Data-collection methods included interviews with the participants at the beginning and end of the 12-week cycle, reflection logs from the weekly meetings, artifacts collected that were produced by the school and the participants, and field notes from class observations. The findings revealed that the PD helped the participants and supported them in the use of Google Drive apps in their classes. It also provided information for developing future professional development programs at the school. Additional outcomes point to future research in designing a system of long term support for the teachers as they continue to use technology at the school, and for development of PD for other Japanese teachers outside of the English department. This work is significant in that there are no other studies of Google Drive PD for teachers, or integration of the technology in Japan. Also, the study evaluates the effectiveness of the PD beyond the participants' perceptions of the experience, and contemplates creating an extended experience to support teachers over the long term.

       " \"For technology integration to achieve intended instructional objectives, professional development is of paramount importance for in-service instructors. Technology enhanced reflection providing multimodality and evidence-based data has the potential of helping instructors achieve technology integration in their teaching. Thus, this study addressed the lack of professional development programs for in-service English language instructors aiming at technology integration through evidence-based multimodal reflective practices. By following the developmental research methodology, an instrumental case study was conducted using mixed-methods design including both qualitative and quantitative data. The professional training was carried out with eight English language instructors at tertiary level who aimed to integrate technology into their English classes by being involved in evidence-based multimodal reflective practice. In this study, there were five different data sources (instructors' opinions, recorded lessons, video annotations, face-to-face interaction notes and pages in the learning management system) and seven data collection tools (interviews, tutor reflection template, self-reflection template, peer-reflection template, technology integration questionnaire, online discussion forums and evaluation criteria form). As a result, this professional training particularly designed and implemented for the in-service English language instructors at tertiary level did make a change in their both technology integration and evidence-based multimodal reflective practice. Apart from the change in the instructors' technology integration, this study had an impact on their understanding, practice and quality of reflective practice involving evidence-based multimodal reflection tools as it helped the instructors to increase depth in their evidence-based multimodal reflective practice.\",\n",
       " \"Language students often struggle to understand the logic in foreign language grammar, reducing their ability to reproduce and create texts on their own. There are several reasons for this; everything from the methodology to lack of motivation might influence the situation. Since the 1980's, Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) has become one of the fastest-growing areas of development in language learning and teaching. Several point to new technology as a great possibility in the area of language learning. Can new technology available to practically all students enable them to improve their understanding of the logic behind languages? An alternative to the traditional ways of teaching grammar could be to focus &quot;on the advantages provided by technology already available, [... and] on how the teacher should utilize the fact that more and more students [...] are bringing their own devices to class. There are certain advantages provided by usage of mobile technology in class that are difficult to achieve in other ways, like anonymity, engagement by all of the students, peer learning effects&quot; and several others (Talmo &amp; Einum, 2013, para. 3).

       " 'Living in the twenty-first century, life unplugged seems impossible without the Internet, mobile phones, i-products or other types of electronic gadgets for long. While language educators are overwhelmingly occupied with investigating the impact of computers and mobile learning, here is a call to address the value of face-to-face instruction in second language education. The key function of second language learning is to interact with one another in the target language. Younger generations are, however, becoming indulged in and even addicted to the technological tools without significant improvement in language competency and communication skills when compared with predecessors who have less accessibility of such tools that are so prevalent nowadays. The current empirical study explores the possibility of &quot;avatar teacher&quot;, alternatives to over-reliance on online tools, electronic gadgets and robot teachers, and limitations of technology on ESL education. Recommendations of innovative ways to engage learners with controlled amount of technology are made to language education professionals.',\n",
       " 'This paper focuses on the views of twenty-six pre-service and eight in-service English teachers in Hong Kong concerning the information technology courses in their teacher education programmes. The findings of the study show that while both software applications and technological integration in teaching are highlighted in the course outline, the instructor focused more on the application aspect, with the technology integration being less emphasised. Another important finding is that PowerPoint was still the most commonly used application in teaching. Likewise, usually the involved pre-service and in-service teachers just simply used different computer applications as alternatives to traditional teaching resources. This may reflect the fact that the information technology courses are not adequate to prepare teachers to teach with it.',\n",
       " \"Prensky (&quot;On the Horizon&quot; 9:1-6, 2001a, b) and other proponents of the concept of 'digital natives' claim that the current generation of undergraduates possesses advanced knowledge and skills in Information Communication Technologies and is highly motivated to learn in this mode. In contrast, there are studies that revealed a variation in the levels of students' access and a greater tendency to use it for social rather than academic purposes. This suggests that the concept of 'digital natives' need further investigation. Studies undertaken on digital natives in Malaysia have generally shown that students are receptive to technology use in learning English; however, no study has clearly delineated the characteristics of Malaysian 'digital natives'. Thus, the present study intends to fill this gap in knowledge by exploring Malaysian 'digital natives' usage of technologies in terms of extent of use, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use and the influence of learning styles on this usage by juxtaposing the Technology Acceptance Model with Willing's learning styles construct. A questionnaire survey was used to collect data which were analysed quantitatively. The findings support those of other studies undertaken in other countries. The students only used common technological tools such as emails and Facebook and generally had positive perceptions of the usefulness and ease of use of technology in the learning of English, regardless of learning styles. Although students expressed interest in using more technology, they were using less technology than anticipated in their learning of English and showed a preference for teacher-centred learning.\",\n",

It explores the experiences and self-efficacy of participants with respect to the evaluation of the current English teacher education curriculum for CALL at a university in Hong Kong and factors affecting the participants' acceptance and willingness to use CALL. In-depth interviews were conducted with six pre-service EFL teachers to reveal the reality of the teachers' attitudes, perceptions and experiences regarding the use of technology. Findings provide insights into the significance of language teacher education in CALL and ways for fostering pre-service EFL teachers' knowledge and skills in the implementation of CALL. Practical implications are made for effective teacher training for CALL in EFL contexts.\",\n",

       " \"Purpose: Simulation technology has been used as a viable alternative to provide a real life setting in teacher education. Applying mixed-reality classroom simulations to English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) teacher preparation, this qualitative case study aims to examine how pre-service teachers (PSTs) practice culturally and linguistically responsive teaching to work with an English learner (EL) avatar and other avatar students. Design/methodology/approach: Using an embedded single case study, three PSTs' teaching simulations and interviews were collected and analyzed. Findings: This study found PST participants made meaningful connections between theory and practices of culturally and linguistically responsive teaching, particularly by connecting academic concepts to students' life experiences, promoting cultural diversity, using instructional scaffolding and creating a safe environment. Nevertheless, they needed further improvement in incorporating cultural diversity into content lessons, creating a challenging and supportive classroom and developing interactional scaffolding for ELs' language development. The findings also show that while PST participants perceived simulation technology as very beneficial, expanding the range of technological affordances could provide PSTs an opportunity to undertake a full range of critical teaching strategies for ELs. Originality/value: This research contributes to broadening the realm of mixed-reality technology by applying it to ESOL teacher education and has implications for both ESOL teacher educators and simulation technology researchers.\",\n",
       " \"Pronunciation has been historically excluded from the language skills and sub-skills taught in the language classroom (Isaacs, 2009). Several factors or limitations such as a lack of training and time, and not being an English native speaker, among others, contribute to teachers' feelings of insecurity when teaching this language sub-skill (Derwing &amp; Munro, 2015). Nevertheless, nowadays, the use of technology opens new possibilities for English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers and students to benefit from online resources specifically designed to teach pronunciation while using animated, authentic, and appealing materials in their lessons (Hismanoglu, 2010). In this respect, the present study aimed at exploring EFL teachers' attitudes toward using technology to teach pronunciation, the online resources they mostly use for this purpose, and their opinion of the resources' benefits and limitations. Participants were ten EFL teachers from the School of Languages of a Mexican university. The research adopted a qualitative approach under a constructivist paradigm. The method for data collection consisted of a semi-structured interview analyzed using inductive analysis. The results revealed that teachers have a positive attitude towards using technology to teach pronunciation. Their awareness of the benefits technology offers to students facilitates the teaching of segmental and suprasegmental features. However, the study discovered that some teachers neglect pronunciation teaching with or without technology, and most of them only use the repetition drill technique in face-to-face classes. Besides, teachers' lack of experience in using pronunciation software and time constraints point to the need for teachers' professional development program that helps them develop technological skills and awakens their interest in this language area. Finally, among other factors, the study identified those factors that specifically affect the teaching of pronunciation with technology.\",\n",
       " \"The significance of assessment as a learning component has led to the development of a sound assessment system that supports the teaching and learning objectives. Achievement of learning assessment should prioritize assessment &quot;as&quot; learning (AaL) and assessment &quot;for&quot; learning (AfL) rather than the assessment &quot;of&quot; learning (AoL). The appropriate AaL and AfL have influenced the process of AoL. Almost all teachers in Indonesia have faced the challenge of implementing Aal and AfL. This study used a qualitative study to report English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers' perceptions and challenges regarding technology-based AfL and AaL. The design of the study was content analysis using the coding procedure and the grounded theory framework as the analytical foundation. Data gathered involved conducting structured interviews with 60 EFL teachers from three central provinces within Indonesia. The findings revealed that EFL teachers in Indonesia had different perspectives about technology-based AfL and AaL as flourishing assessment approaches. Most of the EFL teachers' perceptions said that due to a lack of time, large classes, and lack of knowledge and training on technology-based AfL and AaL principles and practices in EFL contexts, implementation of technology-based AfL and AaL was viewed as challenging. The study has implications for EFL teachers and trainers in developing an instructional model of technology-based AfL and AaL.\",\n",

       " \"This article shares case studies from in-depth research that investigates Latino immigrant families' use of technology, focusing on family technology practices that were interest-driven, cross-setting, and in some cases also collaborative among family members. Three cases illustrate ways that families--all of whom included elementary school-age children--were innovative in their use of technology to learn, as well as how digital resources served to help children and parents explore content across settings. Beyond documenting families' existing practices, the study also examined what happened when each family received a tablet device with curated language- and literacy-related content. We focus on three types of connections that families made: 1) aligning access to rich content at home and school leading to more exploration of academically relevant material; 2) expanding parents' roles as collaborative learners of English as a second language among other topics; and 3) digital production that connects civic, STEM, and language practices. We highlight ways in which families used innovative approaches to get the most out of the devices and content they had access to. We also explore how factors including technology infrastructure, opacity of the app marketplace, and cost can constrain families' opportunities to learn with technology.\",\n",
       " \"The practice of integrating pedagogical approaches using multimedia technologies has become one of the common interests in education in recent years. The technology-based approaches such as computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) and electronic literacy approach (ELA) are spreading widely in English language teaching (ELT) at present. The research reported in this article studied the characteristics of CSCL tasks in the context of ELT in higher secondary school education in Nepal. Nonparticipant observation of the CSCL tasks assigned to the students in the English class in two different schools, and semi-structured interviews with the students were used as research tools. It was found in the study that the CSCL tasks were useful for enhancing some cognitive skills of the students, though many of the CSCL tasks assigned were more exam-oriented and the teachers gave limited attention to enhance students' higher order thinking skills. This shows that the integration of technology-aided new modes of learning do not in themselves foster higher-order learning; that goal requires deliberate curricular and pedagogical efforts of educators. This study offers new insights for the teachers, students, educators and all others who are interested in technology-based education.\",\n",

Supporting evidence of the participants' aptitude in TBLT practice is provided by a traditional, non-IWB-oriented task each individual had designed earlier. Combining both elements in the analysis, our study answers the question: to what extent are pre-service teachers able to design a TBLT environment involving modern technology that adheres to iTILT principles and current theories of TBLT methodology?

In a high school classroom, students write, videotape, and edit public service announcements, documentaries, and films. Students from the Seattle metropolitan area create stories via digital cameras and blogs and publish them on social websites, where they also debate community issues. These are just a few examples of technology-enhanced, instructional approaches that northwest teachers use to help students develop the literacy skills they need. While reading and writing continue to be the fundamental skills of literacy, technology--when integrated effectively--can be a powerful tool for instruction. Schools must teach students to succeed in the information economy. They must integrate technology into literacy instruction. This is Literacy 2.0.',\n",
       " 'Recent technology advancements have increased the prospects for automated spoken language technology to provide feedback on speaking performance. In this study we examined user perceptions of using an automated feedback system for preparing for the TOEFL iBT® test. Test takers and language teachers evaluated three types of machine-generated feedback: domain sub-scores, task scores, and scores based on individual linguistic features. Results showed that the vast majority of the participants perceived all feedback types to be useful, although the teachers showed slightly more scepticism than the students. We believe that these findings provide initial support for making such feedback available to those preparing for the TOEFL iBT test or other similar tests of spoken language proficiency. Study outcomes also inform our understanding of the role of technology in test preparation and the extent to which the use of technology changes preparation behaviours and preferences.',\n",
       " \"With its characteristics of repeated practice and easy review, e-Learning programs have been hailed as an effective way for learning foreign languages nowadays. Supported by ICT (Information &amp; Communication Technology), e-Learning offers students self-paced learning whereby learners can control their schedules and it is presumed to be a round-the-clock teaching aid to EFL students. As many scholars anticipate that e-Learning will become a future trend in EFL, more and more higher education institutions are investing money on English e-Learning programs in the hope that students' English proficiency will be further upgraded by using the ubiquitous system. After investigating students' frequency of using English e-learning programs in a local university in Taipei, the author argues in this paper that e-Learning programs do not benefit EFL students to the degree as we anticipated given the fact that cold technology and machines can never successfully become a &quot;facilitator&quot; that should be played by a teacher. (Harmer, 2000) After all, technology can never take the place of the teacher, who is thought to be the most crucial element of any teaching activities.\",\n",

Five dimensions of secondary school (type of school, demographic, leadership quality, teaching and learning culture, and teachers' personal and working experience) were examined to determine the maximizing usage of TEC (technology-enhanced classroom) in the learning program. In general, there is a significant difference among factors stated above with maximizing usage of TEC in teaching and learning of science and mathematics in English program. The learning culture is also closely related. In addition, the school and teaching staff are another two essential factors found to be the strong fundamental of maximizing the usage of technology in TEC teaching and learning with towering quality. This study represents an addition to the extant literature on maximizing the usage of technology-enhanced teaching and learning towards the excellence of education in the secondary school system. The maximizing usage of TEC teaching and learning environment within the secondary school system is pivotal towards achieving high quality human capital and improving the efficiency and integrity of technology-enhanced learning of science and mathematics in English program.

       " \"To ensure the successful implementation of technology in young learners' classroom, the significant role of teachers in the appropriate use of related technologies should be considered. The purpose of this study was thus to examine the attitude, knowledge, use, and challenges of English teachers of young learners to integrate technological tools into language classes. Survey data were collected from 95 young learner English language teachers working in language institutes and schools in Iran. The survey was comprised of four parts, namely technological tools questionnaire, teachers' attitude questionnaire, teachers' challenges questionnaire, and 11 open-ended questions. The results of the study revealed that there was a general positive tendency towards the integration of technology into young learner classes. The results also showed that most teachers did not have sufficient pedagogical and technological knowledge to use technology to teach the English language to young learners. The findings also revealed that a large number of teachers were not provided with training courses on the use of technology in young learners' classes; however, they were willing to participate in technology-based professional development programs. Limited computer facilities, teachers' lack of skills, and lack of support from schools and institutes were found to be the major challenges of using technology in young learners' classes. The findings of this study encourage other researchers to carry out more in-depth studies on the implementation of technological tools in language classes of young learners.\",\n",

       " \"In the southeastern United States, many local school districts have mandated an increased use of instructional technology to address low reading proficiency among English language learners (ELLs). However, local district leaders and stakeholders concurred that additional research was needed to explore how teachers were using technology in their instructional practices for the academic content proficiency of ELLs. The purpose of this qualitative multisite case study was to explore Grade 3-5 teachers' perceptions of and experiences using instructional technology during reading instruction with ELLs; consequently, the research questions addressed these perceptions and experiences. The substitution, augmentation, redefinition, and modification (SAMR) model was the conceptual framework in this study. The purposeful sample included twelve reading teachers who were required to use technology during classroom instruction and whose classes were more than 51% ELLs. Additionally, each participant had more than two years of ELL teaching experience and either English Second Other Language certification or training in the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol. Data were collected through observations, semi-structured interviews, and a document analysis of lesson plans. Using the SAMR model as a lens, the data were thematically analyzed and assigned a priori, open, and axial codes. The findings indicated that teachers may benefit from professional development focused on more effectively implementing reading instructional technology, specifically when modifying or redefining instruction with technology. The implications for positive social change include stakeholders and ELL students benefitting from enhanced reading and transformative instructional practices by directly addressing the instructional practices taking place in elementary ELL classrooms.

       " \"Several studies have been published to date about the use of Augmented Reality (AR) as a breakthrough technology in education, but most of them focused on the impact of using prepackaged information on student motivation and engagement. This paper analyzes the affordances and limitations of AR in second language learning, emphasizing its potential as transformative rather than delivery technology in teacher training programs. The novelty of this research is that it examines the attitudes and creative skills of pre-service teachers to meaningfully integrate AR-based projects aimed at teaching English from a Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning model. The sample size was 229 Education students from the University of Alicante (Spain), who created 47 vision-based and location-based projects through different authoring tools, and utilized them to teach English to children. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered through a pre-post-test, teaching experience videos and class debates. The research findings revealed that the teacher candidates lack practical training in AR content creation and implementation from a technological and pedagogical perspective, but their attitudes towards AR integration as transformative technology were very positive, particularly regarding student attention, collaboration and shared enjoyment. Spearman's Rho correlation coefficient also demonstrated a relationship between positive attitudes towards AR integration in EFL and the level of difficulty perceived by participants.\",\n",
       " \"Computer technology provides spaces and locales for language learning. However, learning style preference and demographic variables may affect the effectiveness of technology use for a desired goal. Adapting Reid's pioneering Perceptual Learning Style Preference Questionnaire (PLSPQ), this study investigated the relations of university students' learning styles and the use of computer technology for language learning, and whether the demographic variables of gender and age would make a difference. Chinese students aged 17-36 years (M = 20.31, SD = 3.42) from two universities in Hong Kong (N = 401: male = 140 and female = 261) responded to a survey about four learning styles and computer technology. Principal components analysis and confirmatory factor analysis established the five factors, which were all positively correlated. No gender differences were found in technology application and learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and tactile). Only some subtle age differences were found in kinesthetic and tactile styles but not in technology use. Structural equation modeling found significant relations of computer use with visual and kinesthetic learning styles but not auditory and tactile styles. Evidence points to the benefit of helping the learners to discover their own learning styles, and optimizing learners' visual and kinesthetic learning for the use of computer resources and activities for language learning.\",\n",

The conveyance of knowledge through technology becomes fast, easy, and enjoyable for the learner while vastly improving the understanding of concepts. Research insights reveal that through the use of technological tools, the participatory capacity of students increases, and interest levels are raised. Education has evolved, over the centuries, in its form, nature, and manner of deliverance. When written communication had not yet developed, word of mouth and observation were the most common means of passing knowledge from one generation to the next. Teaching was mostly verbal, delivered through plays, songs, and poems. Writing as a means of communication only gained significance by the end of the 15th century. The use of chalkboards and blackboards as a method of learning and teaching gained popularity at the end of the 18th century. Still, now in the 21st century, more advanced technological tools play an important role in facilitating learning and teaching.

This project was originally designed to help all kinds of learners to achieve better communicative competencies in English. An empirical mixedmethod data collection process was conducted involving 49 students in their fourth year of the Teaching of English in Primary Education Degree. To this end, a semi-structured questionnaire and participants' one-course-work self-assessment written testimony were analysed in depth. The findings were significant in that the levels of motivation reported by the students were reflected in their English language oral skills, since the use of technology affected their stimulus in multifaceted ways. This endeavour provided an enhanced version of the CELSIP, a more fitted to different learners online didactic toolset, based on the gathered data. The CELSIP has proven to be a useful source of materials for online learning and could play an important role in addressing the issue of how technology can be used to overcome the existing problems derived from diversity in regard to different types of learning styles. The pedagogical implications suggest that these students could &quot;learn to learn&quot; following the 21st Century Education long-life-learning guidelines after having used the CELSIP.\",\n",

As a result of the sudden shift to online instruction, teachers at the Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics Academy middle school had little time to prepare and had limited resources to deliver an innovative curriculum. However, when schools returned to in-person learning and when COVID-19 relief funds were allocated to the school site to purchase new technology, these teachers gained access to more technology in their classrooms than ever before. This paper describes how teachers at this site leveraged the technological tools to achieve two goals: making the curriculum comprehensible and engaging for English learners to raise assessment scores; and using the technology to connect with their students. To achieve these goals, teachers were taught how to coalesce their tools in three ways: translating texts; digitizing their paper-based lessons; and &quot;mirroring&quot; input from their tablet computers to a larger screen. During an eight-week training, teachers implemented these innovations in their classrooms, reported their successes and reflected on their practice. This paper describes how four teachers used these tools inside their classrooms for innovative English language instruction.\",\n",

       " \"The educational potential of mobile and social media technologies in combination is becoming increasingly salient with the advance of modern technology. However, there is a dearth in the research on educational use of mobile social media for language learning. This study adopted a qualitative single case study approach to investigate a language teacher's integration of mobile social media in the context of higher education in mainland China, with the aim of exploring educational affordances of mobile social media for language teaching and learning and understanding the relationship between the teacher's technology use and her private theories about technology integration. Data were collected from observation, interviews, as well as documents and artifacts provided by the teacher. Qualitative content analysis was conducted to analyze the data. Five educational affordances of mobile social media emerged from the results, including a motivating environment, resources accessing and sharing, evaluation and feedback offering, administration for learning, and content generation. Results also showed that the teacher's private theories about technology integration changed with her adoption of these affordances. However, such changes did not lead to student-centered technology-based learning designs. Implications for teachers as well as teacher educators are provided. Directions for future research are suggested.\",\n",

       " \"Recent CALL research suggests that the arrival of new technologies in the language classroom has led to an increased dominance of the socio-constructivist paradigm (Felix, 2006). Borg (2006) suggests, however, that the hegemony of this paradigm may not extend beyond well-researched university and private ESL contexts. The present study tests this prediction by examining the integration of interactive whiteboard (IWB) technology by non-native speaking teachers of EFL in state schools in France and Germany. Teachers' cognitions were investigated via longitudinal qualitative empirical data, involving classroom observations, video recordings of lessons, in-depth interviews and video-stimulated reflections. Findings suggest that in spite of communicatively oriented, socio-constructivist training, teachers used IWB technology to implement a variety of different approaches. The paper traces teachers' use of different models, from traditional grammar-translation to more communicative and constructivist models of task and project-based learning. It shows how individual teachers' approaches are shaped by a variety of factors, such as teachers' teaching and learning experience, pedagogical beliefs and institutional demands. These findings illustrate the complexities of technology integration in CALL and show how teachers often adapt or ignore hegemonic pedagogies to construct their own representations of the technology which are more in line with their curricular and personal goals.

       " 'This paper details a 2-year study of exemplary uses of electronic texts (information displayed electronically on a computer screen) in two English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) learning contexts. Topics include the following: the need and desire to communicate; opportunities for topic control; and opportunities for planned and unplanned discourses. Language and literacy are socially mediated and socially constructed phenomena. Where technology is commonly viewed as a venue for independent, non-social activity, quite the opposite has been observed by researchers. Indeed, the presence of technology in conjunction with the goals, purposes, and epistemologies of these teachers is resulting in a unique and powerful classroom dynamic where children are taking control of their own  meaning-making with teachers scaffolding and guiding the process. The manner in which these activities can be orchestrated and supported by technology is instructive for teachers, teacher educators, administrators, and curriculum developers as they consider roles for the technology in various language and literacy-oriented school contexts. Electronic texts and the machines that carry them can be springboards and supports for reading, writing, listening, speaking, and thinking. Such uses demonstrate the real and potential language and literacy implications of computers and electronic texts when these tools are thoughtfully integrated into instructional contexts. When properly used, electronic texts can offer novel and empowering roles for learners and their teachers. (Contains 18  references.) (KFT)',\n",
       " 'The idea of competency-based, or mastery, learning has been around for decades, but it has recently been receiving more global attention as a foundation for English language teaching and learning. Because technology use can be integral to the attainment of competency, language teachers who use computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in their classrooms should be aware of the principles and practices that can lead to competency. This paper argues that, for this to happen, CALL teacher educators and other professional development providers need to use a competency approach to make sure that the teachers in their classrooms are as prepared as they can be to engage their English language learners (ELLs) actively in mastering language, content, and technology. After presenting this position, the paper provides a detailed definition and description of competency-based learning and suggests ways that it can be integrated into CALL teacher education.

Design: The qualitative study was based on a literature review, consultations and testing of a framework through workshops and an interactive information session. Setting: Consultations, workshops and an information session conducted in western regions of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Method: A framework was designed to address the needs of CALD community members to self-manage chronic conditions using innovative digital technology strategies. This was based on the literature review and 20 consultations held with representatives from health service providers and community organizations. The framework was tested with the assistance of the Quang Minh Buddhist Temple through consultations, workshops and an interactive information session about diabetes, YouTube and digital video cameras, in which 38 elderly women from the Vietnamese community participated. A descriptive and thematic analysis of participant feedback was conducted to determine lessons for future practice. Results: Participant feedback indicated that the information session achieved its goal of raising awareness of ways to use and access diabetes information using digital technology. However, participants noted areas for enhancement and improvement, including more focused and targeted engagement with peer-led techniques, the digital proficiency of participants and digital technology preferences based on age and cultural background. Conclusion: Digital technology was used to improve diabetes awareness information with elderly Vietnamese women, demonstrating the potential for application with others from CALD communities. However, there are continuing challenges in this approach, indicating the need for nuanced community engagement strategies that consider cultural context and familiarity with different kinds of digital technology.

       " \"Technology is widely involved across the learning environment including its integration into teaching English as a foreign language (EFL); however, few studies have explored EFL teachers' perceptions of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK). This study investigates how EFL teachers perceive and self-evaluate knowledge of content (CK), pedagogy (PK), and technology (TK), the interplay of these with each other (TPACK), and the underlying influential factors for TPACK construction. The data were gathered in China from an online survey (n = 64) comprising 35 items on the TPACK components, and self-evaluation by nine survey participants of their TPACK in follow-up interviews. WeChat, the most popular social media App in China, was utilised as the data collection tool. The survey reveals teachers' strong beliefs in the value of PK, CK and PCK and their positive beliefs about technological applications in EFL instruction. Consistent with these results, interviewees' self-evaluation of TPACK demonstrates that they felt a high level of confidence in CK, PK and PCK but relatively less confidence when technology was integrated despite commonly applying technology to instruction. Influential factors include: 1) contextual factors; 2) knowledge of students; 3) demographic background; and 4) availability of quality training. Decision-makers' financial support and policy-making, technological training in the integration of CK and/or PK, and a collaborative learning strategy are recommended.\",\n",

Informed by a sociocultural perspective and Bill Green's 3-D model (Green, 1988), the study views technology as a complex social, multimodal and multidimensional practice which requires relevant capabilities--technoliteracy. The case studies focus on four international students and their experiences with technology use in ESL. This paper introduces five interrelated categories of challenges--navigation, comprehension, application of discourses, critical analysis and the affective domain. It also outlines the capabilities required for technoliteracy practices in ESL--the English language capabilities, ICT capabilities, contextual capabilities and critical capabilities. The discussion focuses on the need for educators to rethink the use of ICT in a language classroom.\",\n",
       " 'Education worldwide has emphasized 21st-century competencies, including language competence, computer competence, and thinking skills. Research on Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), essential teacher knowledge, has attempted to address the need for technology integration to support thinking skills. However, existing TPACK assessments have not intended to help teachers understand the levels of technology integration in teaching English as a foreign language (EFL). Therefore, this study proposed a two-dimensional TPACK scale, allowing EFL teachers to assess their TPACK in integrating technology and thinking skills. In total, 525 EFL teachers responded to this survey online. Scores of this scale were collected to test and establish validity and reliability. The statistical evidence showed that this instrument has high reliability and validity and is helpful for understanding levels of technology integration. The results showed that the EFL teachers were less confident in their TPACK teaching higher-order thinking skills. The EFL teachers in different cultures reported different confidence levels in TPACK and thinking skills (F(6, 518) = 7.83, p &lt; 0.001). The high-achieving EFL teachers reported high TPACK self-efficacy (r = 0.210, p &lt; 0.05). This TPACK survey would be helpful for EFL teachers to understand their development of TPACK in integrating technology and thinking skills in teaching English.',\n",

This study inspected the status quo of technology integration in Iranian EFL classes and investigated the obstacles, as perceived by the Iranian EFL teachers, toward implementing CALL in Iran. First, 100 EFL teachers completed the Teacher Technology Integration Survey developed by Vannatta and Banister (2009), to help estimate technology use in EFL classes. Then the researchers interviewed twelve teachers, comprising two EFL teacher educators with no CALL experience, four teachers with the experience of integrating technology in their EFL classes, four EFL teachers who had recently finished an online CALL teacher education program, and two EFL teachers with no CALL experience. The semi-structured interview questions were designed by the researchers, one of whom has extensive experience with CALL, and were revised based on the suggestions of a colleague with expertise in teacher education. One of the researchers conducted the interviews, each of which lasted for 30-50 minutes. The researchers used structural content analysis of the interview transcripts to find themes relevant to the research question. The results suggest that on the whole, Iranian EFL teachers do not usually integrate digital technology into their classes; and the obstacles in implementing CALL in language classrooms could be classified into three categories: teacher, facility, and learner constraints. Each of the categories is discussed in detail and suggestions are provided for promoting CALL in the Iranian context.',\n",

Drawing on Beach's (2003) conceptualization of transfer as &quot;consequential transition,&quot; this qualitative study seeks a cross-contextual understanding of language teacher learning with digital technology as the teachers in this study moved from a CTE course back to their own teaching contexts. Near the end of a CTE course, 19 in-service language teachers were asked to build connections between their experiences in the course and their teaching by creating a presentation. Four types of connections were identified, including thoughtful action planning, past experience refinement, and limited and reluctant use. In-depth interviews eight months later with four of the teachers found that they could seldom use the tools in the ways they had planned. However, they each experienced consequential transition as they struggled to reflect on their CTE course experience in everyday teaching. These results challenge the view that transfer in CTE must be about using technology. It is suggested that a focus on critical reflection of technology use may encourage teachers to continue reflective engagement in the ever-changing and complicated digital learning and teaching context.\",\n",

       " \"In the Iranian education context where the concept of Sustainability Education is to a certain extent novel and fresh, one must first determine the state of Sustainability Education in education systems and specifically TEFL departments to discover EFL instructors' needs. This way, EFL instructors can be equipped with Sustainability Education competencies needed for transforming EFL education systems. Sustainability Education can be best implemented through language learning and specifically English learning compared with other subjects because language classes are the best sights for discussing sustainability issues. Additionally, the actualization of Sustainability Education in language classes can facilitate CLT and global citizenship operationalization. Having these in mind, the present study attempts to depict a clear picture of Sustainability Education among EFL instructors and provide education systems and policymakers with the necessary Sustainability Education competencies to equip teachers and help learners to feel and identify the relationship among sustainability issues such as culture, ecology, economy, power structures, and even their own families. The study was conducted using a Sustainability Education questionnaire developed by the researchers. The questionnaire was distributed among 150 EFL instructors. The findings of the study reveal that EFL instructors experience an apparent lack of sustainability literacy. On the other hand, their level of implementation is better than literacy but still not much satisfactory. The important findings can bring about the transformation and modification of EFL teacher education and curriculum and will be highly advantageous regarding professional and ethical dimensions of education system.\",\n",
       " \"The senior high school curriculum has only been implemented recently by the Department of Education in the Philippines; therefore studies delving into teaching and learning in these levels are very limited including the negotiations of teachers with students through online resources. Using Goldwich's (2009) framework as guide, the negotiations of the teachers were determined through interviews where five English teachers express how they negotiated and how the use of the online resources help in the development of the linguistic competence of students in learning of the English language. The study looked also into the perspectives of the teachers towards the use of technology in their instruction following Davis (1989) Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). After the narratives of the teachers, three themes referring to the negotiation strategies were articulated in this study: snug, simple and, systematic. Snug referred to the teachers' strategies in preparation for the tasks; simplicity referred to the clarity and brevity of the teachers' strategies; and, systematic referred to strategies that are logical and procedural enabling students to follow the teachers' instructions. After evaluating the use of technology in their instruction, the teachers' statements show that the linguistic competence of the students are developed through the constant exposure they have with the activities they conduct online and the tasks they need to accomplish.\",\n",
       " \"Embedding web-based learning systems in education has drawn increasing popularity and growing interest among the contemporary language education community in recent time. In particular, blogs have become a profound phenomenon in the present landscape of online education. However, research addressing the instructor's perspective about the engagement of blog technology in second language education is still lagging behind. The current study seeks to explore and survey the perspectives of six Malaysian academicians on the use of blogs in teaching English as second language to Malaysian students at higher education institutions. A qualitative approach was adopted to collect responses from the participants via a semi-structured interview. In addition, a checklist of features of the blog was used to investigate the blogging activities in the courses conducted by the participants. The collected data from the interview were analyzed qualitatively, whereas the blog checklist data were analyzed quantitatively. The obtained results indicated that the surveyed instructors had a positive reflection on using blogs in the teaching and learning of the English as second language.\",\n",
       " \"This study aimed to investigate whether a digital storytelling (DS)-integrated pedagogy was effective for developing students' self-efficacy and attitudes toward educational technology. 43 English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) English-major students from the School of Foreign Languages (SFL) at Sivas Cumhuriyet University (SCU) participated into this study. There were two groups in the study, namely experimental and control groups. The experimental group was exposed to DS-integrated instruction while no intervention was given to the control group. Control group students followed their regular course requirements. Before and after the experiment, both groups were tested by using a survey aiming to determine learners' self-efficacy beliefs for and attitudes towards the use of technology in education. The quantitative data indicated that the exposure to DS impacted the experimental group students' efficacy and attitudes toward educational technology in the positive direction. However, the control group students' scores did not exhibit a noticeable change. The qualitative data also documented that students heightened their self-efficacy and had a positive stance for the use of technology in their learning as a result of participation into this experiment. The resulting information can be helpful for those who are willing to create a teaching environment that meets the needs and expectations of 21st century students.\",\n",

       " \"While technology has undoubtedly improved and has become an essential component of modern life, technological advances' consequences have both beneficial and detrimental impacts on students' writing skills in the classroom. Technology has accelerated and simplified work for students, but it has also instilled the belief that there is no need to put significant effort into the texts they write. This study examines the effects of technology and auto-correction on students' writing skills at three different universities in Sulaimaneyah city, Iraq. Case studies and research into the impact of electronic and communication devices on English writing skills among university students has been analyzed to determine the effect of autocorrection on grammar, vocabulary, spelling, and punctuation. Furthermore, the study also aims to show that auto-correction affects students' writing and to compare auto-correction and handwriting to prove that students make mistakes while writing due to technology. In addition, the study examines writing tasks undertaken by students in the English language to assess students' lack of writing skills, particularly in spelling. Finally, the study identifies why students have poor writing skills and corroborate previous research into an auto-corrections negative impact on students' writing abilities.\",\n",
       " 'This study investigated the impact of a CALL teacher education workshop guided by the TPACK-in-Action model (Tai, 2013). This model is framed within Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK, Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006) and advocates a learning-by-doing approach (Chapelle &amp; Hegelheimer, 2004) to understand how English teachers develop CALL competency and adopt the competency in their teaching. Participants were 24 elementary English teachers in Taiwan. The study used a mixed methods design (Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2007), collecting and analyzing qualitative and quantitative data concurrently but separately before they were triangulated. Findings show that the TPACK-in-Action workshops had a positive impact on the 24 teachers. In addition to the development of CALL competency, it was also observed that participants demonstrated CALL competency in their teaching, such as selecting online materials and appropriate technology for content teaching, using cloud computing for student interaction, and matching the affordances of technology to meet their instructional goals and pedagogy. In sum, the study provides empirical evidence and a new perspective in the investigation of CALL teacher education. The theoretical and pedagogical implications for CALL teacher education research and practice are discussed.',\n",
       " \"Teachers fostering future-ready graduates need to master updated pedagogical and technological knowledge, so teacher professional development (TPD) is essential. Conventional TPD activities such as seminars and workshops are limited as they require specific time blocks and lack flexibility. The current study investigated TPD through microlearning courses in online and blended learning modes as an innovative TPD approach in Hong Kong. We applied a qualitative approach and thirty-two preservice teachers in the English language education program participated. The data were collected using questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and observations for data collection. The pre-service teachers' digital competencies were evaluated against an observation protocol based on the SAMR framework and TPACK model. The effects of microlearning and the participants' digital competence needs were also identified. The results revealed how pre-service teachers perceived the integration of technology and the challenges they encountered (e.g., design of learning tasks and time management). Based on the findings, personalized and hands-on training is recommended to fulfill teachers' diverse learning targets in applying specific technology and deepen their understanding of technology use. Furthermore, as more conceptual frameworks for assisting microlearning in TPD are necessary, this study can help enrich the underpinning theories for the microlearning design of TPD.\",\n",
       " 'This paper explores university student access to and use of technology in Azerbaijan in the context of hegemony in computer-assisted language learning (CALL). Due to perceptions of a lack of technology access in the university context, the instructors in this study did not initially pursue a CALL agenda. Based on data sources that included a questionnaire, photographs, documents, journals, and interviews, the results of the study indicated that despite instructor perceptions, many students used and had access to various forms of technology on a regular basis. For example, students used computers and mobile devices to pursue different kinds of knowledge outside of the university. Implications include the importance of the deconstruction of instructor assumptions so that they can be critical educators and make choices that can lead to social change.

       " \"In the realm of language proficiency assessments, the domain description inference and the extrapolation inference are key components of a validity argument. Biber et al.'s description of the lexicogrammatical features of the spoken and written registers in the T2K-SWAL corpus has served as support for the TOEFL iBT test's domain description and extrapolation inferences. In the time since the T2K-SWAL corpus was collected, however, university learning environments have increasingly become technology-mediated. Accordingly, any description of the linguistic features of university language should account for the language produced in technology-mediated learning environments (TMLEs) in addition to non-technology-mediated learning environments (non-TMLEs). Kyle et al. recently began to address this issue by collecting a corpus of TMLE language use, which they then compared to language use in non-TMLEs using multidimensional analysis (MDA). The results indicated both similarities and substantive differences across the learning environments, but the study did not investigate the effects of particular registers on these results. In this study, we build on previous research by investigating lexicogrammatical features of specific spoken and written registers across technology-mediated and non-technology-mediated learning environments.\",\n",
       " \"As researchers in the CALL teacher education field noted, teachers play the pivotal role in the language learning classrooms because they are the gate keepers who decide whether technology or CALL has a place in their teaching, and they select technology to support their teaching, which determines what CALL activities language learners are exposed to and how learners use them (Hubbard 2008). While a considerable amount of research related to CALL teacher education has focused on teachers' attitudes, beliefs, and confidence regarding CALL (e.g., Kamhi-Stein, 2000; Kassen &amp; Higgins, 1997; Lam, 2000; Peters, 2006; van Olphen, 2007), there are very few studies that have investigated the impact of CALL teacher education programs (Desjardins &amp; Peters, 2007; Hegelheimer, 2006; Kessler, 2007; Kilickaya, 2009). These studies reported that teachers confirmed their learning and adoption of CALL into their classroom teaching; however, the findings are based on self-report data, which are insufficient for capturing actual classrooms CALL integration. Moreover, the Call for Papers in the January 2013 issue of the Language Learning and Technology Journal calls for research in CALL teacher education to &quot;address another crucial factor affecting the degree and quality of implementation: teachers' CALL competencies and knowledge base&quot; (p. 145). In view of the need to bridge the gap and to develop a fuller picture of how teachers integrate CALL in the classrooms, the present study used an observation instrument based on the TPACK framework (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006) to investigate the impact of TPACK-in-Action workshops had on English teachers in Taiwan from four different perspectives: whether the CALL workshops (1) met participants' expectations in helping them integrate CALL; (2) contributed to participants' perception change toward CALL and CALL integration; (3) helped participants develop their TPACK competencies; and (4) helped participants adopt the learned CALL competencies into their classrooms. The 15-hour TPACK-in-Action CALL workshops were conducted as part of the teacher professional development for 24 elementary English Teachers in Taiwan. The TPACK-in-Action model (Tai &amp; Chuang, 2012), developed specifically to help English teachers integrate CALL, was employed to guide the design of the workshops. Situated in the mixed methods research design with the guidance of the TPACK framework, qualitative data through reflections, interviews, and observations, and quantitative data through surveys and reflections, were collected before, during, and after the CALL workshops to help identify the impact of the TPACK-in-Action workshops. Findings of the present study showed that the TPACK-in-Action CALL workshops had a strong and positive impact on elementary English teachers in Taiwan. In addition to helping them showing positive perception changes toward CALL integration, it was observed that the workshops helped participants develop CALL competencies, such as integrating online materials, using cloud computing for student interaction, selecting appropriate technology for content teaching, and matching the affordance of technology to their instructional goals and pedagogy as well as adopt the learned competencies into classroom teaching. Findings indicated that observations were found to be effective in investigating the impact of the TPACK-in-Action CALL workshops. Not only were observation data triangulated with self-report data to prevent potential discrepancies from happening, they helped identify teachers' CALL competencies and visualize their CALL integration. In sum, this dissertation contributed to providing empirical evidence on the effect of using observation as a measure to understand how teachers integrate CALL in their classrooms and adding a new perspective while investigating CALL teacher education. It also has theoretical implication for CALL teacher education research and pedagogical implications for CALL teacher education practice.

       " \"The present study is set to systematically review articles on the use of 360-degree video technology in language learning. The study selected and reviewed twenty-four articles in the following aspects: (1) tools related to 360-degree video technology; (2) languages and skills involved; (3) theories and pedagogical approaches in reviewed articles; (4) methodology of reviewed studies; (5) applications of 360-degree video technology to language learning; (6) reported findings; and (7) reported problems in reviewed studies. The results demonstrated that the tools related to 360-degree video technology can be grouped according to the following three ways of using them: (1) creating or editing videos/images, (2) obtaining videos/images, and (3) viewing videos/images. The participants in most studies recorded or edited 360-degree videos to develop their own learning content, rather than using existing one. In most studies, the participants used head-mounted displays (HMDs) to view 360-degree videos and low-cost HMDs were used more frequently. Scholars often focused on English and Chinese, and they targeted speaking and writing skills in their research. Various theories were used to frame research and the embodied cognition theory was the most popular. The most commonly used pedagogical approach was task-based learning. Fewer studies focused on students from primary or junior school. Many studies lasted for more than one month. Different language skills were mainly measured using scales or tests. Findings related to learning outcomes, learners' perceptions of using 360-degree video technology and motivation were most frequently reported in the reviewed studies. Finally, problems related to methodology, technology implementation and learning process were identified in the reviewed studies and they are reported in the present research. Based on the results, several suggestions were made and implications derived.\",\n",

The study defines creativity as ability to explore, adapt, take risks, collaborate, communicate, reflect on, and innovate with novel, unpredictable, and appropriate resources. To examine a research question of how creativity was manifested in an online practicum course, two main data sets were analyzed: VoiceThread projects (talks and texts) and final papers. Findings are presented under each of three themes of creativity in action: creativity as collaborative critical reflection, creativity transformed as new pedagogy, and creativity mediated by technology. First, creativity was exercised as collaborative participation by which practicum students shared ideas, suggestions, and resources through a high-level reflexivity among peers through guided feedback. Second, creativity was translated as new linguistically and culturally responsive teaching-oriented pedagogical plans and practices. Finally, innovative use of the instructional technology--teaching videos and VoiceThread--was the key to enhancing teachers' critical and transformative view of their own teaching and to increasing opportunities to learn in a safe and collaborative communal space.\",\n",

       " \"Since we are living in the information age and the importance of the need for communication among people of different cultures is increasing day by day in the globalizing world, people need to learn the languages of different cultures, particularly English, which is the common language of this global communication. This need for learning English requires trained qualified teachers of English. A scan of those who are teaching English in schools of Bangladesh reveals that most of them are very limited in both English skills and teaching methodologies for English. This situation is exacerbated when one moves into the rural areas. Most of the teachers are staying far away from the teachers' training colleges and also for different constraint like administrative, financial, time constraint and were also unable to receive any training due to family problems. So Distance Education has a great demand to them. ICT is an effective media of distance education. For many years, universities with a significant commitment to distance and open education institutions have been at the forefront of adopting new technologies to increase access to education and training opportunities. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is an umbrella term that includes all technologies for the manipulation and communication of information. Bangladesh Open University (BOU) is till now belonging to the second generation of distance education model but due to the enhancement of technology in Bangladesh, BOU can proceed further. The main purpose of this study is to identify a suitable technology for developing a virtual interactive teachers' training program for the disadvantaged English teachers of Bangladesh. Respondents were selected through random sampling and data were analyzed using both descriptive statistics and quantitative themes. From the opinion of the secondary English teachers their access and acceptability on ICT was identified and also a need analysis was done. It is hoped that the result of this study will encourage the policy makers to implement new ODL approaches for the training of disadvantaged rural English teachers.\",\n",
       " \"Distance education between the student and the teacher through online sessions can make it difficult for a student who does not understand a concept to ask for clarification. Lack of a physical campus or social pressure from peers can demotivate students from completing their assignments. The framework of multi-intelligence English teaching based on cloud technology (MIET-CT) is introduced to solve these kinds of issues. The method of blended learning (BL) combines in-person instruction with digital resources to improve distance and open education by examining the efficacy of a learning strategy, with an emphasis on collaborative and autonomous learning (CAL) by artificial intelligence (AI). Cloud technology can potentially encourage students' independent learning as a cognitive tool by providing a cloud platform and multimedia instruction by domain modeling. As a result, various English teaching styles have been shown to increase student's motivation to learn and provide more impressive classroom results than conventional methods.\",\n",
       " 'Communications technologies such as Web-based conferencing and chat are being used increasingly around the world by instructors and students in either face to face or distance learning courses. While some discuss the affects of this phenomena, others are more focused on how these technological tools can be used in specific courses to achieve desired learning outcomes. This article shares experiences in using electronic conferencing in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) teacher education courses. It discusses strategies that have been used with electronic conferences, lessons learned, and implications for further research. Covered topics include instructional strategies for the WebBoard, WebBoard orientation, book reviews, chat rooms, and lessons learned. It is  concluded that the technology involved remains only an enabler and facilitator of instruction. That all this can be meaningful and productive for the learner is a function of pedagogy; more specifically, skill in exploiting technology for language learning purposes and not of technology in and of itself. The WebBoard makes sharing and collaborating and engaging in high-level learning tasks feasible. The WebBoards not only facilitate learning, but they can redefine roles for the student and instructor, allowing students to be designers of their own learning by setting, regulating, and achieving goals that they have a large role in deciding.

Two scales were used to collect the data: TPACK scale developed by Tseng (314-315) and Mobile Learning Tools Acceptance Scale (MLTAS) developed by Özer and Kiliç (586). The results showed that high school students perceived the TPACK of EFL teachers positively with all subcategories. They were also found to have positive perceptions of mobile learning tools. The study concluded that the more knowledge students perceived, the more they accept mobile learning tools.',\n",
       " 'The importance of a structured learning framework or interrelated frameworks is the cornerstone of a solid English as a foreign language (EFL) computer-assisted language learning (CALL) curriculum. While the benefits of CALL are widely promoted in the literature, there is often an endemic discord separating theory and practice. Oftentimes the promise of new technologies is mitigated by a lack of pedagogical consideration. While continuous upgrades are an essential component of any curriculum, using technology as a motivational tool in the classroom without clear and research-based teaching approaches and techniques is a slippery slope. A balance must be struck between infusing educational technology in the classroom with pedagogy. This article illustrates a course design processes, combining CALL usage and pedagogy for second-year language learners in a Japanese university listening course.

       " \"In recent years, the role of technology in language classrooms has grown in importance. Due to recent developments in the education sector, technology-enhanced language learning (TELL) has come into the spotlight. Previous studies have shown that technology encourages both instructors and students to take an active role in the language learning process. In light of the widespread adoption and enabling power of immersive technologies and the potential applications of TELL, it is imperative that the literature be continuously investigated to identify the types and tendencies of recent studies in order to understand current practises and guide future research in the field with two research questions; RQ1: What are the trends and practices of TELL in language teaching and learning? and RQ2: What are the research methodologies employed in TELL studies? This review carefully examines the overall research trends and practises in language education in order to chart the development of TELL during the past few years. Out of 87 publications found in 2020-2022, 17 were selected using exclusion and inclusion criteria from Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. Using five codes obtained from previous systematic reviews, we performed an analysis and synthesis of these publications. The codes are: (1) aim, (2) methodology, (3) sample, (4) country, and (5) outcomes. The bulk of the studies used a quantitative research technique to look into TELL trends and practises in language teaching and learning, and the systematic review found that TELL was more widespread in universities than in other types of schools, with the lowest occurrence seen in primary schools. In light of these findings, suggestions for more investigation were made. Academicians are urged to broaden the scope of future study and include students from all levels of education in future TELL practises in order to better understand TELL's usage in language teaching and learning.\",\n",

Active participants made higher gains than inactive participants It was concluded that in learning environments where technology is unavailable to EFL students and instructors, the use of technology from home and even as a supplement to traditional classroom techniques helps motivate and enhance EFL students' learning and acquisition of English vocabulary.\",\n",
       " \"This article addresses critical issues regarding students' access to textbooks, curriculum materials, equipment, and technology. Using California as a case, it reviews the importance of these instructional materials to education, generally, and in the context of current standards-based education policies. Based on data from a variety of sources, we find that textbooks, curriculum materials, and technology are educationally important and that the consequences of not having them are particularly harsh in a high-stakes, standards-based education system. We also find that many California students do not have the numbers or quality of textbooks, curriculum materials, and technology that they require to meet the content standards the state has set. Compounding the problem, shortages and poor quality of textbooks and instructional materials often exist in concert with other problematic school conditions -- staffing shortages, facilities in disrepair, and overcrowding. Schools serving English learners and low-income students are most affected by shortages. A third set of findings details how actions by the state have either contributed to or failed to prevent students' lack of access to textbooks, curriculum materials, and technology. Finally, considering California's own policies and those in other states, we conclude that California does have policy options that would be far more likely to ensure that all students have the texts and materials they need and/or detect and correct problems in the supply and quality of texts and materials when they occur.\",\n",

Among all the possible technological tools that can be integrated into EFL classes, computers seem to have achieved a more dominant position. One of the outstanding features of computers is their potential to present educational games and to add fun to grammar learning. This study investigated the possible effects of the integration of CALL technology on young Iranian elementary EFL learners' grammar gain. Moreover, it examined the role of length of exposure to find an optimum balance for the proper amount of CALL integration to language activities. One control and two experimental groups, each consisted of 15 participants, were engaged. One of the experimental groups used CALL technology for twice as long as the other group. &quot;Family and Friends 2&quot; with its accompanying MultiRom was utilized in the experimental groups. This software presented computer-based grammar activities. All the participants tried their answers in separate immediate as well as delayed post-tests. The results of one way ANOVA demonstrated significant differences between control and experimental groups in the immediate post-test. The findings of the delayed post-test showed that a significant difference did exist between the control group and the second experimental group. Furthermore, the length of exposure was found to be influential. The results of this study provide some insights for teachers and administrators to review their curricula, approaches, and educational tools, and to consider the possibility of incorporating CALL technology into their teaching environments.\",\n",

Consequently, a number of teachers are now using interactive technology in the classroom although it has not been systematically implemented or widely studied. Understanding the approaches of successful EFL teachers--specifically, how teachers using an andragogic approach through experiential learning might affect student engagement--was the purpose of this qualitative study. The conceptual framework focused on student-centered learning and included Knowles's theory of andragogy and Kolb's experiential learning. The perceptions of 10 EFL teachers chosen through purposeful sampling and who regularly used technology in the classroom were gauged through structured interviews, direct observations, and document analysis. Emergent themes were extracted from the data through interpretive analysis. Results supported the fact that andragogic-based tasks with technology increased student engagement in the Japanese EFL university classroom by directly improving interaction between students and by stimulating communication and autonomous learning. The outcome of the study was a professional development program that was designed to provide better teacher training on facilitating technology-based lessons that engage learners and improve their language skills. Positive social change will result from providing better teacher training that focuses on facilitating technology-based lessons that engage Japanese university learners' full potential and improve their language skills in more meaningful ways.

       " \"This paper moves away from reminiscent mechanical repetition and drills, which were in vogue when teaching vocabulary before the rise of technology. With the support of technology, innovative methodologies that are more effective and enjoyable can be implemented into vocabulary teaching. In this particular context, there seems to be a lack of technology integration in vocabulary teaching because of teachers being untrained and/or not provided with the necessary technology. The aim of this study was to foster vocabulary development through the implementation of Vine vocabulary videos in English vocabulary learning. An embedded mixed methods design was employed to collect necessary data for analysis. The results of the post-test revealed that the practice of Vine vocabulary videos was effective and improved participants' vocabulary. The content analysis of the semi-structured interviews carried out with participants indicated that they had enjoyed the whole process and found it very motivating and effective. This study claims that adopting smartphones into a vocabulary course will enable English as a foreign language learners to expand and consolidate their vocabulary learning outside the classroom, engage them in a collaborative learning environment, practice and use the language being learnt and share their knowledge and experiences with their peers.\",\n",

One of the recent emerging technologies, context-aware augmented reality (AR) technology can mitigate this problem for EFL classrooms. In the present study, 40 college students created scenes of gamified digital stories on a location-based AR app and shared them with other students. This study investigated how the students used the physical context and properties in their scenes and how the technology facilitated language learning. Data were collected from student learning outcomes, post-surveys, and reflection papers. The results showed that the students employed context in three different ways, a real place, a fictional setting and a blended reality, and then integrated it with their content and transformed it into a co-constructed meaning-making site. The study also discovered that the technology supported the students' language learning in the affective, cognitive, and social domains. All elements found in the three domains were interrelated and ultimately contributed to student learning.\",\n",

The role of information and communications technologies is revealed, in particular the interactive technology of self-regulation developed by the authors, as a necessary pedagogical condition for the successful professional self-realization of students. The paper describes the interactive technology of self-regulation formation used in teaching a foreign language in order to improve the educational process. The paper provides an analysis of the current state of the classroom educational environment in teaching a foreign language in order to determine the possibilities of improving the educational process. The main goal of the interactive technology of self-regulation formation is to optimize and intensify the activities of students in the classroom and extracurricular activities. The interactive technology of self-regulation formation in a nonlinguistic university was applied in the proposed work. Special attention was paid to the problem of structuring and the algorithmization of independent work. Ways for increasing interactivity are revealed, and an algorithm for teaching and speech actions in interactive mode was developed. It was established that the introduction of structured algorithmization using the interactive technology of self-regulation formation could be effectively used for teaching poorly prepared students. It has been established that the culture of professional self-actualization for modern students is directly dependent on the quality of online interaction with a university teacher. It was revealed that it is the student's awareness of the objectives of learning interaction and ways for its implementation that allow him to competently perform his academic work, which in turn contributes to the actualization of personal professional qualities that are required by a university graduate for successful implementation in the future.\",\n",

To accomplish effective technology-enhanced instruction, SLW teachers must blend their knowledge of composition theory, second language acquisition, and multimodal composition technologies. However, many teachers struggle to do this, which highlights the need for research addressing the cognitive aspects that influence digital instruction. This case study reports on an investigation of three in-service university SLW teachers' Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) during a digital reflective portfolio module. Data from an online survey, instructional content, classroom observations, and semistructured interviews were triangulated to uncover the nature of SLW teachers' TPACK, including which factors supported and constrained their use of technology. Findings suggest that pedagogical content knowledge played a dominant role in how the teachers used technology. The teachers' TPACK was enhanced by professional beliefs about the importance of multimodality and contextual factors involving institutional support and communities of practice. However, it was constrained by limited self-efficacy and pedagogical beliefs concerning the influence of technology on student learning and student engagement.

It is a challenge for instructors and researchers alike to remain up to date with educational developments and unlock the full potential that technology could have on this significant profession. The &quot;Handbook of Research on Digital Learning&quot; is an essential reference source that explores the different challenges and opportunities that the new and transformative pedagogies have enabled. The challenges will be portrayed through a number of case studies where learners have struggled, managed, and adapted digital technologies in their effort to progress educational goals. Opportunities are revealed and displayed in the form of new methodologies, institutions scenarios, and ongoing research that seeks to optimize the use of such a medium to assist the digital learner in the future of networked education. Featuring research on topics such as mobile learning, self-directed learning, and cultural considerations, this book is ideally designed for teachers, principals, higher education faculty, deans, curriculum developers, instructional designers, educational software developers, IT specialists, students, researchers, and academicians.

       " 'Some studies of technology use by immigrants have explored the role of digital media in their maintenance of affiliations with their nations of origin. However, the potential for transnational social networks to serve as &quot;resources&quot; that facilitate digital literacy socialization for adult immigrant learners remains unexplored. In this study, I draw on the concepts of simultaneity and transnational social fields (Levitt &amp; Glick Schiller, 2004) to analyze the relation between local and remote networks and the use of technology by immigrant learners. The findings reveal the configuration and exchange of resources across nation states, facilitated by family networks and by a local community center with the support of a Mexican institution. The findings also demonstrate the ways in which digital literacy practices were adopted by participants to maintain these transnational connections and to build new networks with local institutions. Implications for community-based technology programs for learners with transnational ties are discussed.',\n",

       " \"This qualitative study was carried out in five different elementary schools in the Czech Republic. It aimed to investigate how English as Foreign Language teachers developed teaching competence and practised information communication technology integration in classroom teaching. To this end, this study employed the idea of a Technology Pedagogy and Content Knowledge--TPACK-in-Action Model. It advocates a 'learning by doing' approach on (social) construction to better understand how teachers develop technological and/or computer-assisted language learning competency for teaching and practice in an English as a Foreign Language environment. Under this model, this study conducted qualitative analysis and found two different approaches in practice, which were categorised as Formal Practice and Functional Practice. The former involved a conservative mechanical practice of technology use in language teaching whereas the latter involved it in terms of (social) construction. According to analyses based on conservative practices, teachers expressed that mechanical TPACK in association with technology in classes limited the transmission of mechanical knowledge from English texts. In Functional Practice, however, teachers drawing upon alternative learning interactions expressed positive transformation results from TPACK, associated with the use of technologies integrated into class instructions as a collaborative tool for learning models. In these latter integrated practices, teachers' perceptions, practices, and reflections in combining technologies in an English as a Foreign Language environment, as new literacy skills, identified an increase in the learner's creative potential.\",\n",

       " \"This study examined the effectiveness of a bilingual/bicultural technology intervention on beginning learners of Spanish at a public university in the United States and intermediate learners of English at a public university in Mexico. This study used a quasi-experimental mixed method design and compared gains in grammar, listening, and reading skills between treatment groups using technology to communicate and practice the target language with native speakers, and control groups using technology to communicate and practice the target language among classmates. Students' knowledge of technology and learning style were also assessed, and an open-ended survey was used to examine the influence of the online activities on students' proficiency and the relationship between belonging to a learning community and successfully finishing the course. All treatment and control groups obtained similar gains in reading and grammar. Additionally, US students in both groups obtained significant results in listening. No significant relationship was found between students' learning style or their technology proficiency and their outcomes. Results suggested that the creation of learning communities inside and outside the classroom were important elements for earning a passing grade in the course. The use of new technologies did not hinder students' learning of the language at the beginning levels. Beginning learners did not appear to have any difficulty engaging in real-life exchanges online to practice newly acquired knowledge, and they appeared to have the necessary maturity, motivation and independence to carry out online exchanges with native speakers as part of the class curriculum.

       " \"This study investigates foreign language teachers' beliefs about information and communication technology (ICT) and factors contributing to their belief formation through in-depth interviews with eight teachers and the principal of a public primary school. The participants held overall slightly positive attitudes towards the effectiveness of ICT in English education but believed it played only a subsidiary role in their pedagogical practices and professional development. Elementary English teachers' ICT-related beliefs were shaped by individual-, institutional-, and policy-level factors. The study extends belief-related components of the technology acceptance model (TAM) by clarifying the external variables into three-level factors. The results suggest the need for in-service teacher education programmes and joint efforts from individual teachers, school management, and government authorities catering to teachers' ICT beliefs.\",\n",
       " \"In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, households around the world experienced a surge in remote learning and teaching. However, as many teachers and students can attest, online education was not initiated by the pandemic. Online programs had already become well established over the past few decades--in higher education (Moore, Dickson-Deane, and Galyen 2011), alternative access schools and online classes in public-school settings (Turley and Graham 2019; Sanders and Lokey-Vega 2020), and synchronous tutoring at all levels (Herrera Bohórquez, Largo Rodríguez, and Viáfara González 2019). In particular, the demand for online English tutors and teachers has soared as the number of English speakers around the world increased to nearly two billion (British Council 2013). The intention with this article is to narrate the path of two higher-education professors' pivots in their own teaching to support in-service and licensure-candidate teachers in the midst of the pandemic. Because of the narrative nature of online course design (Dickerson 2017) that was utilized, the authors chose to write this paper in first person in keeping with this narrative style. First, Elena King outlines the framework used to design an &quot;Online Pedagogy in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)&quot; course. Then they discuss the collaboration initiated and the reflection performed surrounding multiculturalism within technology and equity, as Molly Riddle transitioned from a traditional post-baccalaureate &quot;technology and assessment&quot; course to one focused on preparing teachers for teaching solely, and equitably, online. They clarify with examples of how to use the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK) framework and notions of equitable digital access to create an exchange of ideas to enhance learning. They conclude with four takeaways that we hope will guide teacher educators, as well as their current and future teaching force, as they navigate technology both in the classroom and as the classroom.\",\n",
       " \"This study investigated the impact of a flipped approach to EFL classes on learners' use of technology and their attitudes toward technology for language learning. Among 428 EFL primary school learners divided into four groups, two groups confirmed to have homogenous attitudes regarding technology participated in this study. Each group was randomly assigned to experimental (n = 88) or control (n = 92) groups. A flipped approach was selected to organize a 17 week-long EFL course for the experimental group, while, for the control group, a non-flipped and blended approach was chosen to organize the same course. A wide range of technologies were utilized to both groups to facilitate English learning. Data were collected from pre- and post-technology surveys, learner interviews, and reflection logs. The survey consisted of four constructs: digital literacy, usefulness, anxiety, and comfort. The quantitative findings revealed that the experimental group showed more enhanced digital literacy and usefulness and decreased anxiety than the control group. Thematic analysis of qualitative data supplemented the survey findings by providing insights into why the flipped approach had a more positive impact on those constructs than control conditions. This study demonstrated the potential of a flipped approach for young learners studying within a public school system.\",\n",
       " \"The main purpose of this study was to design and implement a professional development programme on technology integration for teachers in a public education centre based on the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework and learning by design approach, and to evaluate the programme's impact. Ten adult education teachers in a public education centre participated in this case study research. Data sources include teacher-reflective reports, lesson plans and focus group interviews. The results revealed that the programme both enhanced teachers' TPACK and influenced their teaching practices. The results emphasise the importance of providing information that aligns with teachers' specific needs in adult education centres, giving teachers an active role, making opportunities available to design technology-enhanced learning artefacts while working in collaborative teams and selecting ICT tools based on typical adult learning characteristics. The study also offers suggestions for future research and practice on the design of professional development programmes.\",\n",
       " \"Foreign language bilingual education has been common in many countries all over the world for many years after the Quebec issue in the 1970s. However, after all these years, bilingual education still remains as a criticized way of education. This research essay examined the most significant criticism by summarizing it into seven common misconceptions of the bilingual education schooling system in Spain in general education English-Spanish 1st-12th grade. A lot of criticism has been directed towards the differences between regular mainstream classes and bilingual classes especially in Primary education. This paper looks at seven commonly addressed issues. The paper especially focuses on Primary education but most revision matters also relate to secondary and even higher education. Special interest is paid to cognitive, social, economic, mode of bilingual education, role of the immigrant students and parents' attitudes. The conclusion leads to the understanding that English-Spanish bilingual education is not pernicious but, on the contrary, benefits the cognitive a linguistic development of most school children.\",\n",
       " \"A mixed-methods study examines the impact of the pandemic-driven move to virtual learning on K-12 (kindergarten through twelfth grade) English teacher experiences in Saudi Arabia to inform future development of the teaching of English in the country. Research is limited in K-12 English instruction in the country, and it is just emerging on the pandemic's impact on education in the MENA region. The 35 subjects were English educators who completed the Saudi government-sponsored professional development program, Khbrat, at one U.S. university. Contextualized within the literature on technology in instruction, leadership frameworks, and Vision 2030 education reforms, the study explores the convergence of technological, institutional, and socio-cultural factors affecting innovation in English education to address the research question of how the pandemic has impacted Khbrat graduates as EFL teachers and as change agents in their country. Integrated analysis of survey and interview data reveals patterns of both acceleration and constraint. Findings suggest pathways to leverage virtual technology and acquired knowledge and skills of Khbrat English teacher graduates to deliver EFL professional development with a more pedagogical focus and to build coalitions among EFL educators to sustain the forward movement of innovation in English education in post-pandemic Saudi Arabia. The study concludes with recommendations for future applications.\",\n",

This paper explores the Radio Language Arts Project (RLAP), an application of instructional radio technology to the teaching of English as a foreign language. The advantages and disadvantages of the use of radio in education are noted, and successful realizations of radio's potential in Kenya and Nicaragua are described. The subject matter, English, is analyzed from the perspective of the Kenyan curriculum and the radio medium. The most significant instructional design principles used by the RLAP are enumerated. These are: more intensive use of radio and for longer periods, cost control,  systematic instructional development, provision for distributed learning and immediate reinforcement, and the teacher/radio partnership. Finally, the formative and summative evaluation strategies for the RLAP are described and the project's implications are considered. (Author/AMH)\",\n",
       " \"The article's main aim is to highlight the challenges English language education faced in Ukraine after the outbreak of the pandemic. Since Ukrainian education had traditionally been face-to-face before the crisis, and technology integration was slow, the lack of online infrastructure and distance learning methodologies in Ukrainian universities aggravated uncertainty and anxiety regarding learning quality. The authors show how the Vinnytsia State Mykhailo Kotsiubynskyi Pedagogical University (VSPU) withstands the challenge of reflecting on the experience, which might be typical of higher education institutions. The research engages 321 future teachers of English and applies mixed methods.

       " \"This autoethnographic study examined the tensions affecting the identity of a teacher in charge of an online English academic writing module during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reflections written over one academic year were examined using performativity as an analytical lens. The analysis identified three types of tensions: performing for proximity, performing to meet the institution's and student's expectations, and continuously changing performances. These tensions highlight the teacher's performativity when using technology, which ultimately configured his teacher identity. From these tensions, the paradox of technology may be observed. Specifically, tools supposedly productive for an online class may not necessarily be well received by students and may burden the teacher.\",\n",

Student teachers' perception  plays an important role because they will educate out next generation. The purpose of the  study was to explore Taiwan EFL student teachers' perceptions about their learning  experiences, beliefs, and self-efficacy on Internet-assisted language learning and teaching.  Bandura's social cognitive theory (1986) indicates that people's previous experiences and  personal beliefs will influence their behaviors; Davis (1989) expresses that learners'  internal attitude and self-efficacy about a technology program will determine their  hereafter intentions to use the program or not. For gaining a comprehensive  understanding about Taiwan EFL student teachers' perceptions on Internet-assisted  language teaching and learning, a quantitative research method was employed in this  study. The participants of the study were two classes of 101 senior student teachers taking  the EFL courses in Wenzao Ursuline College of Languages in Taiwan during the fall  semester of 2007. A questionnaire on student teachers' perceptions toward Internet-assisted  language teaching and learning was administered to participants. Data are reported in  numbers and percentages of student responses. The major finding indicate that most of  EFL student teachers have positive experiences and attitudes toward the use of  Internet-assisted language instruction and consider technology to be an important  approach in their future teaching careers. However, approximately one fourth of EFL  student teachers in this study still do not feel confidence enough and were unsure whether  they possess the skills and knowledge of technology to integrate technology into their future EFL classrooms.

       " \"Flipped learning has become a strategic approach for educators to implement a technological-based learning environment. In line with the Malaysia Education Blueprint, more and more educational institutions adopt flipped learning into their establishment in a vision to achieve students' maximum potential. With a focus on technology, flipped learning is often linked with strategic management, excellent performance as well as the positive impact on instructors and students' skill. The implementation of flipped learning is a way to introduce different teaching and learning ideas that can develop an active classroom. The concept is to have a balance between education and advanced technology. This paper aims to review the three research elements, which are the level of participants involved in this study, the instruments, and disciplines done by 19 researchers on the flipped learning approach. Findings show that most of the studies have significant results in the implementation of the flipped learning approach. Conclusively, flipped learning is a well-rounded approach where it can be applied in any level of education regardless of the discipline. However, longitudinal studies can be performed in order to see the long-term effects of the flipped learning approach.\",\n",
       " 'COVID-19 has impacted education negatively to a certain extent by suspending schools and universities, ending face-to-face and practical education, and causing a rapid transition to distance education. These changes have led to several negative effects on teachers and students such as anxiety, stress, and depression, which demonstrates the importance of teacher preparedness to teach at unprecedented times such as COVID19. Therefore, assessing and evaluating teacher preparedness has become significant. One way to do this is to evaluate teacher education programs with a new perspective developed considering the effects of COVID-19 on education. Therefore, the present study aimed to find out how teacher education programs can prepare teachers to teach at unprecedented times by focusing on the English language teacher education program (ELTEP) of Turkey. It was designed as a qualitative study in which the ELTEP of Turkey was used as the data collection tool. The collected data were content analyzed. The findings have shown that the ELTEP of Turkey can prepare pre-service English language teachers to teach at unprecedented times through three psychological courses, five technology courses, and 21 pedagogical courses.

       " \"The effective use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can have positive effects on the development of learners' English abilities. To what degree it is effective is partly determined by learners' characteristics in ICT use. However, these characteristics have not yet been sufficiently discussed in Japan. This study, then, explored how the characteristics of Japanese EFL university students related to their actual use of an online English course and whether it led to the development of their English abilities. In the survey, 130 Japanese university students were asked to self-evaluate their attitudes toward computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and the use of technology in an out-of-classroom situation. As a result, it became clear that most of the students were not confident in using the technology and did not use it actively outside the classroom. Cluster analysis was employed with a focus on individual differences, revealing that the time students actually spent on the course and their high evaluations of the effectiveness of CALL did not necessarily predict development of English abilities. It was suggested that individual differences should be carefully considered in adopting online English courses effectively in higher education institutions.\",\n",

There is a general scholarly consensus that it was through his educational efforts that English medium education came to Muslims who were otherwise aligned with traditional religious education. The commentary argues that this consensus needs revision and that Muslims were already accessing modern education through the English medium even before Syed Ahmed started his college at Aligarh. Moreover, the commentary also problematizes the notion of Muslim community within Syed Ahmed's thought. Through his writings and speeches, it is pointed out that for Syed Ahmed, the notion of Muslim community was confined to upper caste Muslims called the Ashrafs. Also, Syed Ahmed's views were extremely regressive when it came to women's education. Despite Aligarh being a modern university which is accessible to all castes and gender, Syed Ahmed's legacy has not been critically analysed. The commentary is a small start in this direction\",\n",

       " \"It is crucial to study how L2 learners use technology when examining the lifespan technology in L2 pedagogy. Therefore, we adopted Gartner's hype cycles to investigate the lifespan of CALL from the perspectives of EFL learners. To this end, we utilized an explanatory narrative design and gathered and analysed the perspectives of 87 EFL learners regarding the CALL lifespan using autobiographical narratives and semi-structured interviews. The results of the deductive thematic analysis presented motivating and demotivating factors that were asserted to affect EFL learners' uptake of CALL technologies. Moreover, the findings revealed that EFL learners had fallacies about CALL in the first stages of using technology for L2 learning and tended to reduce those fallacies later on. Therefore, it can be concluded that EFL learners start their use of CALL with some misconceptions stemming from the motivating factors of CALL, continue their use of CALL by facing some demotivating factors originating from fallacies about CALL that they have already committed, and finalise their use of CALL by exploring about CALL features that help them avoid their fallacies. The study has implications to shorten the time of reaching the awareness zone by the L2 learners.\",\n",
       " 'Education opens numerous revenues to register economic expansion all around the world with specific reference to developing nations. Advancement of Pakistan in education indicators has been severely insufficient during the previous decades. Decreased financing along with inefficiency in budget expenditure plus weak management system have crippled the education sector ensuing poor educational outcomes. Outcome-based Education (OBE) has recently gained much attention in Pakistan. OBE is used in education because it clearly focuses and organizes everything in an educational system around what is necessary for all students to be able to do at the end of their learning. OBE proposes an influential and interesting option of transforming and organizing medical education. Therefore, the basic aim of this review is to highlight the tertiary education system of Pakistan and the need to shift from teacher centered to Outcome Based Education system. The review also addresses the major factors that impact student learning outcomes. Data bases were searched including Cochrane and Medline. Search strategy was designed by combining Boolean operators and key terms related to review objectives. Seven studies were included in the paper regarding the effectiveness of Outcome Based Education in different disciplines of education. The findings suggested five important factors from the literature that impact student learning outcomes including, assessment strategies, learning objectives based on level of complexity, student preferred learning styles, English language competency and Employer requirements. However, limitations were recognized in the methodology section and further recommendations were given for future researchers.',\n",
       " \"Research in the field of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) has frequently taken a top-down approach when investigating learners' attitudes and behavior, both in the course as well as for their personal use. Suggestions are given for use of technology, and future research (Beatty, 2010; Levy &amp; Stockwell, 2006). One perspective that has not been examined in CALL is Reflexive Photography, a method that lends itself to rigorous and focused analysis and can illuminate the participants' experiences and perceptions in a way that the above methods cannot. In reflexive photography, participants are asked to photograph their experience of the phenomenon in question. These photographs serve as the basis for the discussion with the researcher that follows, and help to define the scope of the particular phenomenon. Together, the participants and the researcher co-produce the information regarding the phenomenon (Jenkings, Woodward &amp; Winter, 2008). Reflexive photography has been used to explore issues of identity and experience in other fields, although in CALL, it has been underutilized. The present study identified current uses of technology among International Teaching Assistants (ITAs) taking a course to improve their spoken English intelligibility. Midway through the term, learners photographed what they deemed to be helpful and what they felt obstructed the improvement of their oral English production. They then shared seven to ten photographs in a focus group of peers. At the end of the term, the researcher interviewed the learners regarding these experiences. The photos and the interviews were coded and the researcher examined the emergent findings, using observations and electronic communication from throughout the term to triangulate and support the data. The findings revealed valuable insights through the eyes of the learners regarding what technology the learners found to be helpful and/or obstructive, both in the course as well as for their personal use, and suggestions for improvements in use of technology are given. Finally, future research directions in CALL using reflexive photography are discussed.\",\n",
       " 'Increased use of recent technological devices by language learners at all ages and various levels stimulates the integration of the latest technological devices into the language learning process. Considering the numerous advantages of augmented reality (AR) in creating a supportive learning environment, this study aimed at investigating the use of quick response codes, as an AR feature, during extensive reading. 28 English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students enrolled in a British culture course at a Turkish university participated in the study. For the purpose of the study, QR code enhanced authentic reading texts were designed to aid learners in the comprehension of culture-specific terms that were difficult to be understood with a dictionary definition. Participants reflected on each QR code implementation, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with randomly selected students. The results of qualitative analysis through open-axial and selective coding procedure revealed three main themes related to QR code enhancement while reading culturally loaded reading texts: the advantages of using QR codes in extensive reading, criticism on the content of QR codes, and technical problems in using QR codes. The findings underline the potential of integrating AR technology such as the QR codes into language education for more effective learning opportunities and highlight the importance of providing access to technology in order to help all students benefit from the ubiquitous nature of technology.',\n",

       " 'Examining the relationship between technology and the success of language acquisition and the integration of technology into language instruction has been around of a long time by now. The development of technology can essentially change how languages are taught. Nevertheless, it is only in the last few years that the road has opened up for new language learning opportunities. In this current study, the impact of a pedagogical intervention is presented grounded on Xeropan, a gamified language learning application. In addition to assessing the impact of the app, a questionnaire was also applied to find out how efficient language learners find language learning with the application. Based on the original aim of the literature and the study, answers were sought as to how Xeropan influences the English language learning process, how student users find Xeropan in terms of efficiency and motivation, and how self-regulated motivation correlates with use of Xeropan. It was found that Xeropan application has a positive impact on language learning processes. There was a visible improvement in language learners, and at the level of some tasks, it was indicated that there was a significant improvement as a result of the developmental intervention using Xeropan. It was also pointed out that students are content to work with Xeropan and find that it has a positive effect on them. Further conclusions are drawn.',\n",

       " 'Educational technology is a significant resource for meaningful, active, sensory, and relevant instruction for limited-English-proficient (LEP) students in the elementary grades, particularly those students who are educationally disadvantaged. It is suitable for bridging the instructional gap in bilingual education so these children can have the same educational opportunities as their English-speaking peers and suffer less the effects of cultural and social segregation. Computer software, compact disk, CD-ROM, and videodisk technology provide and store large quantities of subject matter, allow individualization of instruction and instructional materials, permit children to learn at their own speed, and are motivating and non-threatening. These characteristics are useful in  instruction in English as a second language, in both one-way and two-way bilingual education, for attractive graphics to involve all students, and even to promote parent involvement. To maximize the potential of these technologies, administrators and teachers need training in effective educational applications, particularly in the classroom, and appropriate and pedagogically sound materials.

       " \"Online teaching has globally become a part of the learning process and has been more well-established in developed countries. In developing countries, online teaching or e-Learning is not practiced or recognized officially by educational organizations and policymakers. On the other hand, it is well-known that computers and technology are the future; in such a case, the advancement of distance-learning or online learning is immensely remarkable. It has reduced teachers' and students' introversion concerning e-learning and technology and has provided a platform for learning new technologies and developing new skills. The recent COVID-19 lockdown impelled governments to start implementing E-learning in schools, which resulted in several challenges. This study attempts to analyze and interpret the challenges and potentials of implementing online learning by surveying through an online questionnaire using 'Google Forms' (N = 968) with responses from high school and primary school English teachers during the first week of March through the last week of April. The findings revealed that most teachers had negative perceptions of implementing e-learning for several reasons, including lack of essential facilities such as electricity, electronic devices, and the absence of required skills. The actual contributions of students and educators are also among the major obstacles. This research suggests introducing Information Communication Technology modules across media platforms and applications in the education departments, opening intensive courses for teachers, and developing educational facilities in the education departments and schools to overcome these limitations and challenges.\",\n",

       " \"The developments in the digital age are reflected in foreign language classrooms today, yet, teachers' incompetence resulting from insufficient training about various technologies during their previous education prevent them from integrating technology into their classrooms effectively. Especially with the sudden increasing demand of online teaching due to COVID-19, there is a strong need to handle this issue as teachers continue doing their jobs. However, due to many reasons, in-service teacher training programs have been the subject of criticisms. This paper explains a blueprint for designing and implementing a context-specific in-service teacher training program for using web 2.0 tools in EFL lessons. The participants were 122 English language teachers working at the School of Foreign Languages at Anadolu University. Survey forms were utilized as data collection tools in this design-based study. Eight successive stages were followed in the training program. The feedback gathered both from the learners and the teachers show that both groups appreciated technology integration and the in-service teacher training program. Thus, based on overall findings, this blueprint can be suggested and developed for similar institutions wishing to increase their teachers' competencies in integrating technology into their classrooms.\",\n",

       " 'Education, especially higher education, is considered vital for maintaining national and individual competitiveness in the global knowledge economy. Following the introduction of its &quot;Free Education Policy&quot; as early as 1947, Sri Lanka is now the best performer in basic education in the South Asian region, with a remarkable record in terms of high literacy rates and the achievement of universal primary education. However, access to tertiary education is a bottleneck, due to an acute shortage of university places. In an attempt to address this problem, the government of Sri Lanka has invested heavily in information and communications technologies (ICTs) for distance education. Although this has resulted in some improvement, the authors of this article identify several barriers which are still impeding successful participation for the majority of Sri Lankans wanting to study at tertiary level. These impediments include the lack of infrastructure/resources, low English language proficiency, weak digital literacy, poor quality of materials and insufficient provision of student support. In the hope that future implementations of ICT-enabled education programmes can avoid repeating the mistakes identified by their research in this Sri Lankan case, the authors conclude their paper with a list of suggested policy options.',\n",

China's English learning population is about 400 million, which is bigger than the population of the United States (Z. Li, 2020). Chinese students have been diligently studying English for many years, but most need help to obtain English proficiency after many years of learning. To address the research question regarding the online learning experience of Chinese English learners, the investigator applied qualitative analysis to discover the online education demand, the practical technology, and the immersive learning experience. Fifteen research participants between 18 and 23 years old were recruited and participated in the data collection. After coding and data analysis, eight primary findings revealed that Chinese people need affordable, flexible, and frequent online English academic-purpose education. Online English taught in live classes, and self-studying applications are two practical English-improvement approaches. Moreover, technology makes English learning fast, efficient, and convenient; internet-based small-size English-taught courses and internet-based live communication with native English speakers can create a satisfactory second language learning experience. The conclusions are powerful and meaningful and take the lead in the research of Chinese online English education involving the assistance of technology and identifying the elements that strengthen the effect of second language immersion.

       " \"The present research investigates how translators deal with the challenges of translating culture-specific words from Thai into English within a digital environment. Using strategies suggested by Baker (2018), the study collected data from surveys, written sources and observations to examine which approaches are used by translators. It also addresses how technology impacts the decision making of translators as they create translations employing both Bourdieu's concept of habitus (1977, 1990) and the Actor-Network Theory proposed by Latour (1987, 2005). The findings show that translators use eight primary strategies when translating culture-specific words, with the use of loan words being the most common and literal translation the least used. The habitus of translators possibly influences their translation choices, with technology playing a crucial role in determining which solutions and strategies translators choose. This proves the extent to which technology currently influences translators in the completion of translation tasks in digital environments. Consideration of these factors should be considered as a way to improve translation training in a Thai context.\",\n",
       " \"Computers have taken an increasingly prominent role in education around the world in recent years in developed and developing countries alike. As developing country governments have turned their focus from increasing enrollment to improving the quality of education in their schools, many have made access to computers a key component to their strategies (Trucano, 2005). There is an emerging body of research now that shows that these strategies, which often come with a hefty price tag, have varied effects (Glewwe et al., forthcoming). This paper contributes to this literature by comparing the use of computer-assisted language learning software to traditional methods of English instruction in Costa Rica. The authors also compare two different software programs to one another. Because schools were randomly assigned to one of these two treatment groups or a control group, this research permits a rigorous comparison of the differential effects of two software programs, holding contextual factors constant. The following research questions are addressed: (1) What is the impact of each of the two English language learning software programs on test scores, as compared to a teacher alone; (2) what is the magnitude of the effect of each program compared to the other; and (3) do these effects vary by school-level baseline performance, students' baseline test scores or gender? The main finding of this research is that academic software can be an effective learning tool, but that this depends on the software. Previous research has already shown that technology can be effective in some cases and ineffective in others. One of this paper's contributions is to show that these heterogeneous effects are not simply the product of using technology in different contexts (although that is likely to be important as well). By randomly assigning two different software packages to students in similar schools, this research has shown that the type of technology used matters, holding other factors constant. Furthermore, technology's effectiveness also depends on student characteristics like baseline abilities and gender. Tables and figures are appended.\",\n",

       " 'The eight year old Bilingual Education Act, funded by Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, is discussed in this report. Federal funds have been allocated to more than 500 local education agencies seeking to improve educational opportunities for students in 68 language groups, and to expand educational access for more than 300,000 children of non or limited English speaking ability. In postsecondary education programs, 100 institutions of higher education will offer teacher training and retraining programs to an estimated 25,000 classroom teachers and teacher aides. At the graduate level, the fellowship program will offer degree programs in 42 institutions of higher education reaching more than 500 degree candidates. To develop a more effective  coordinating relationship between the Federal Government and State education agencies, 43 State agencies will receive assistance contract money to carry out bilingual education coordinating services within the State. As a means of insuring a growing and adequate supply of relevant and quality instructional materials, 15 Materials Development Centers and 3 Assessment/Dissemination Centers have been funded to support and meet the needs of rapidly increasing bilingual education programs. A National Clearinghouse on Bilingual Education is scheduled for installation and operation during fiscal year 1978. Four model demonstration bilingual programs will be placed in 16 local education sites for testing in 1978. This will provide an opportunity for the effectiveness of these model demonstration  projects to be determined. (Author/AM)',\n",
       " \"This study focused on identifying EFL teachers' perceptions on the use of ICT in their teaching. A number of 42 EFL teachers from two state universities in Indonesia were involved. A closed-ended questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw, 1989) was distributed and interviews were conducted. The findings revealed that 31 teacher users were found to have high motivation to use ICT because they believe that it is important in ELT as it makes learning enjoyable, interesting, and effective, among other constructive outcomes. Meanwhile, even though the other 11 teacher non-users were aware that the use of ICT is becoming more essential nowadays, their motivation remains low. Their barriers were rooted from the lack of training and support, either financial or non-financial, from their work environment. Therefore, these barriers should become a priority for institutions to overcome, considering that ICT provides unlimited sources of information in ELT and teachers must be prepared to face new challenges in education and technology that are present today.\",\n",
       " \"Augmented reality (AR) technology has been used to successfully improve traditional literacy. However, there has been a paradigm shift in literacy education from traditional literacy to multimodal literacy. Little research has explored how students establish effective multimodal meaning-making using AR technology. This study is an investigation of how EFL college students use different multimodal modes to communicate with others using AR technology. Participants were 52 English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students. The collected data included (a) pre-and post-administrations of a multimodal literacy survey, (b) students' use of different modes to introduce tourist spots within the location-based AR app, and (c) students' reflection essays. The results demonstrated that the modes which students used were categorized into visual and auditory forms. The visual mode was composed of visual effects, images, and animations, whose functions were to focus viewers' attention on what is important, provide concrete ideas, process complex information, and promote engagement. The auditory mode consisted of background music and sound effects, which were used to arouse emotional feelings and enhance immersive experiences. The results also revealed that creating the content in a location-based AR app with the combination of different multimodal media significantly improved students' multimodal literacy.\",\n",

It also investigates how giving and receiving comments from peer students can improve students' performance in writing as well as their critical thinking skills. A combination of 47 peer reviewed studies were included in this review. All these studies were found on MUN online library and the selection criteria I used in searching was studies that are relevant to: ESL writing, the importance of peer feedback and the role that web-based technology can do to facilitate peer feedback in ESL writing classrooms. The results showed that reflective assessment of peers' writing helps students develop their peers' and their own writing performance. They also stressed the role of web-based technology in providing a stimulating environment for students to reflect on peers' written work. However, some studies revealed the challenges that might affect using this technology such as students' reluctance, fear of sharing writing online and their sensitivity to being criticized publicly.\",\n",
       " \"Effective teaching demands educators to have multifarious competencies and skills, which is quite challenging. Lots of research examining the difficulties relating to these concerns has been carried out in traditional faceto-face educational settings notably by focusing on classroom management skills and technological proficiency which are considered crucial for teachers. However, it remains uncertain how instructors use technology and their pedagogical abilities in virtual classrooms and how their approaches to using these skills vary depending on their teaching experience. To that end, by using mixed method research design this study first investigates the pedagogical and technological skills used by instructors in online classes by exploring the challenges instructors have while utilizing technology and employing pedagogical skills, as well as by addressing their way of overcoming those challenges. Furthermore, the research discusses the connection between teachers' demographic data centering on their field of study and their technological and pedagogical expertise in online classes. There are 50 instructors from a preparatory school of a private university as participants. The results show there is no substantial difference between the instructors with different levels of teaching experience while using technology and pedagogical skills in online classrooms. Since ELT teachers outperform those in other fields when using technology, the field is a determinant. To foster utilizing those skills more competently and firmly, seminars, where prospective teachers can apply their technological and instructional skills, could be incorporated into the curricula of each and every field. The provision of pre-service and in-service programs by decision-makers is another way to help present and future teachers in online language education become more technologically proficient. It would not be appropriate to generalize the results to the entire population because of the limited sample size. [The publication year (2022) shown on the PDF is incorrect.

       " 'Recent developments in machine translation (MT) might have led some people to believe that soon professional translation will not be needed, but most translator trainers are aware of the high demand for the quality that MT systems cannot deliver without human intervention. It is thus important that professional translators, trainers and their students appreciate when and how MT can best be deployed, even if they do not use it much themselves. This can be accomplished by enhancing their MT literacy, which encompasses an understanding of the basics, risks and benefits of the technology. Trainers can prepare their students to provide advice to clients who might be interested in using MT for their multilingual content but do not have the expertise to judge when it would be enough to meet their needs. Drawing on the example of knowledge dissemination in higher education, this article presents survey results that suggest MT is being used far more widely than previously assumed. We highlight some of the risks associated with uninformed use of this technology, discuss how they can be mitigated by translation professionals with consulting competence, and outline some training scenarios which could contribute to developing societal AI literacy in general.',\n",
       " \"The current pandemic closed schools worldwide, tasking teachers to engage learners remotely without time to prepare. This study focuses on a professional development webinar series for English language teachers worldwide. Access to geographically dispersed English language teachers created an opportunity to gain international perspectives on teachers' challenges, perceptions, and needs related to transitioning to remote, online teaching. We found webinars were an effective way to provide just-in-time professional development for teachers globally, particularly about engaging students, providing feedback, developing online presence, and creating activities specific for online learning environments. The main challenges teachers reported facing were keeping their students engaged and progressing in the learning activities; unequal student access to technology and the internet; and learning and troubleshooting technology. At the same time, learning new technology and online resources was also what teachers most frequently reported enjoying about remote teaching.\",\n",
       " \"Language learners need to understand and apply appropriate discourse as part of the process of attaining &quot;communicative competence&quot; (Canale, 1983) needed to fulfill academic and social-adaptive functions. Students who are able to apply discourse strategies within the classroom demonstrate higher levels of metacognition and critical thinking (Reznitskaya et al, 2001; Kramarski and Mevarech, 2003; Mercer, 2004). Given the opportunity to reflect upon their own learning, students often become more engaged (Lattuca and Stark, 2011, p. 221). Language educators may better serve contemporary students, who are motivated by effective integration of technology in the curriculum (Knight, 2008) by using this technology to increase opportunities for communication, reflection (metacognition) and overall engagement. This study used a between-subject design involving 68 international students at a university English language program divided between treatment group 1 (n = 37) and treatment group 2 (n = 31). The research examined the effect of annotation functionality within VoiceThread, a popular web-based multimedia platform, as a means to promote participants' acquisition and appropriate use of discourse markers through the process reflecting upon recorded speaking performances. Although the effectiveness of digital annotation technology was not revealed via a significant interaction effect, a significant main effect provides evidence of the effectiveness of more basic VoiceThread functions in promoting communicative language. Follow-up qualitative interviews were used to gain insight into students' experiences with the technology.

       " \"Though pedagogical beliefs have been identified as critical factors in the success of technology integration, very few studies have included them in technology-adoption models. The present study revises the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by adding teachers' pedagogical beliefs, and tests the revised model among university-level English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) teachers in China. Specifically, the revised model examines how teachers' constructivist and/or transmissive pedagogical beliefs influence four key constructs of the TAM: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude toward use, and intention to use. Survey data were collected from 202 Chinese EFL teachers and analyzed using path analysis. The revised model showed a good model fit. The results indicated that the sampled teachers' pedagogical beliefs were more constructivist-oriented than transmissive-oriented, and that the former type of beliefs had a significant positive influence on three of the above-mentioned TAM constructs (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and attitude toward use). Teachers' transmissive pedagogical beliefs, on the other hand, did not have any significant impact on their attitudes toward information and communication technology (ICT) or their perceptions of its usefulness, though such beliefs did significantly affect their perceptions of how easy ICT was to use. Implications of these findings for teacher education and professional training are discussed.\",\n",

Despite the studies on special methods and pedagogy of inclusive education carried out by the educators, there are still no inclusive education achievement indicators enshrined in law. The study uses the following general scientific methods: analysis of the current and prior normative legal acts regulating teachers' activities in the field of inclusive education, analysis of scientific and methodological literature on special, general, and inclusive education, synthesis of definitions of inclusive education concepts as well as a survey of English teachers. The conducted survey demonstrates a range of material, technical, pedagogical, and specific subject-related problems the teachers face in the context of inclusive education. Such problems are determined by the specifics and distinctive characteristics of teaching the English language in inclusive education conditions, as well as the preceding absence of courses on the methods of teaching the English language in inclusive education in the programs of higher educational establishments. One of the main problems identified by the study was insufficient level of teacher training courses to prepare for teaching within the inclusive education, as well as the lack of appropriate methods on teaching English in an inclusive classroom.

While the challenges of the rushed move to online teaching have been well documented, less is known about how teachers adapted to online teaching through professional development. This article focuses on the experiences of four English-language teachers in Indonesian higher education, who took part in an exploratory practice study for the integration of technology-enhanced pedagogical practices in teaching. In this article, we explore the pedagogical puzzles they explored with their students, the challenges faced by the teachers and the gains achieved by undertaking exploratory practice for integrating technology into language teaching in 2021. Drawing on data gathered through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions, we identified that the application of exploratory practice principles enabled the participant teachers to tackle a variety of pedagogical puzzles related to online teaching and professional development. We also found that they overcame a variety of challenges and used potentially exploitable pedagogic activities to better understand students and their learning needs, which encouraged them to recognize students as partners in teaching. Further investments of resources and support are necessary to ensure that language teachers fully benefit from exploratory practice in terms of professional development during and beyond the pandemic.',\n",

Yet, its appeal has not catalysed widespread adoption of dialogic education in classrooms due partly to teachers' uncertainty over the conceptualization of dialogic education and the presence of several similar yet different models in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to critically review several well-known models of dialogic education to uncover some of their shared features as well as differences. Four dialogic education models, 'dialogically organized instruction', 'Thinking Together', 'Accountable Talk' and 'dialogic teaching', are reviewed, compared and critiqued. Based on the review, a framework of dialogic education that synthesizes the features of the four dialogic education models and hinges on four components -- dialogic environment, teaching goal, classroom talk and dialogic moves -- is proposed. This will hopefully help to equip and empower teachers to translate the theoretical principles of dialogic education into actual classroom practices.\",\n",

       " \"Supporters of bilingual education are hoping that the election of Barack Obama as president will lead to a thaw in attitudes toward what they consider a proven educational method that has been ignored--or worse--by the Bush administration. Advocates are encouraged by the endorsement of bilingual education by President-elect Obama in the recent campaign, and see the pending reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act as a vehicle to change federal testing and other policies they view as hostile to dual-language instruction. Obama's education plan--which was posted for months on his Democratic presidential campaign's Web site, but is not on his post-election site--stated that he and his running mate, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, &quot;support transitional bilingual education and will help limited-English-proficient students get ahead by holding schools accountable for making sure these students complete school.&quot; Obama has not defined what he means by &quot;transitional bilingual education.&quot; Many education experts believe his position indicates that his administration will give more attention to bilingual education than has President George W.

       " 'Students of initial teacher education need to be prepared for the classrooms of tomorrow. Teachers require the necessary skills and competences to teach in culturally diverse contexts, to collaborate across disciplines, and to use technologies in innovative ways; but the Digital Economy and Society Index reports that only 20-25% of students in Europe are taught by teachers who are confident using technology in the classroom, and only a small number of students of education are gaining intercultural experience by participating in international mobility programmes such as Erasmus+ (European Commission, 2015a). It is clear that institutions of initial teacher education need to find new ways to prepare their students for the challenges they will meet in the future. This report presents the findings of our study. However, not only do we provide here a large-scale study to demonstrate the impact of virtual exchange in an important field of university education, we also explore how policy makers and university management can take actions to make this methodology more widespread across university education and support students and teachers in its use.

       " \"Successful oral presentation effectually involves multi-faceted training of listening, writing, and nonverbal delivery besides speaking orally, which calls for a systematic holistic/multimodal approach. However, a multimodal learning environment for fostering EFL learners' presentation development remains virtually unexplored. This study employed multimodal strategies adopted from the VARK model (visual, aural, reading/writing, and kinesthetic/gestural) with the support of digital audio, video, and speech visualization technologies in an English presentation course at a university in Taiwan. Two EFL classes served respectively as the experimental group with a technology-mediated multimodal approach and the control group with a traditional oral approach. Specifically, this research evaluated the experimental participants' oral performance and explored their perceptions of this technology-mediated multimodal approach and its advantages and disadvantages as identified by the participants. Results from independent t-tests showed marginal significant progress of presentation performance in the experimental group. Descriptive statistics from the perception survey and content analysis of students' reflective responses indicated that the participants were overwhelmingly positive about technology-supported multimodal activities implemented in the oral training course but encountered psychological and technological challenges when producing multimodal assignments. Theoretically, the results support the extension of multimodal theory to EFL oral presentation education. Practically, the study informs EFL presentation instructors of the validity of technological-enhanced VARK strategies for learning and teaching EFL presentation. The research results also bear significant implications for the necessity of learner training in technology practices when implementing the pedagogy integrating multimodal technologies into EFL speech education.\",\n",
       " 'English, as a language, has become a common way of communication across the globe, resulting in a need for many to read and understand the language. As various countries have opened up to foreigners who seek to do business, study, or live in non-English-speaking countries, the need for having a common language has led to the establishment of English across the world. Over the years, non-native English-speaking countries have developed curriculums for their citizens, especially adults to enable them to teach themselves English. However, the courses have been rather expensive to undertake, leaving the underprivileged looking for alternatives. This paper seeks to look into the issue of accessibility by introducing the benefits of technology in learning English as a Second Language (ESL) and discussing how it has revolutionised teaching in non-native speaking countries. More specifically, this paper will look at Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) and its importance towards teaching ESL. Additionally, it will highlight the importance of technology towards teaching students ESL through software and websites, as well as shed light towards some of the negative aspects of technology integration in ESL adult learning.',\n",

A multiple baseline design was used to investigate the effects of technology-supported LEA on the oral reading of three emerging bilingual (Arabic/English) students with developmental delay, speech-language impairment, or at-risk status. All participants demonstrated slight increases in the number of words read correctly per min on reading curriculum-based measures during technology-supported LEA instruction. Similarly, increases occurred in the number of words read correctly from learner-dictated passages while decreases occurred in the percentage of meaning-change miscues made during oral reading.

       " \"Background: Tele-collaborative projects serve as invaluable platforms for students from diverse countries to engage in cross-cultural communication and exchange cultural knowledge. These projects offer immense benefits in terms of fostering intercultural competence among participants. However, one challenge arises when participants engage in spoken communication rather than written. Those who may not share a common first language often rely on a lingua franca such as English for intercultural communication. In such spoken exchanges, varying levels of language proficiency can lead to communication errors that hinder the intercultural learning process and impede the development of intercultural competence in their fellow participants. Objectives: In the present trial study, our primary objective was to tackle the language-related challenge associated with spoken communication head-on. Our focus centred on addressing the discrepancies arising in spoken communication, and we aimed to mitigate these discrepancies by utilizing speech-enabled corrective feedback technology. Methods: In a tele-collaborative project involving 28 graduate students from the People's Republic of China and Republic of Kazakhstan, the participants engaged in spoken communication and cultural exchange in English via the internet. Given the emphasis on spoken communication and the recognition that English was not their first language, we implemented a speech-enabled corrective feedback (SECF) technology to ensure effective communication in terms of pronunciation, grammar, and word choice. The SECF technology detected and provided instant feedback on any speech mistakes, enabling participants to make corrections accordingly. The main aim of our study was to explore the potential benefits of integrating SECF technology into a tele-collaborative project for the development of participants' intercultural competence. Additionally, we sought to gather insights into the students' perceptions of the SECF support. Results and Conclusions: The results of our study revealed significant improvements in the participants' intercultural competence across dimensions such as knowledge, skills, attitude, and awareness. Furthermore, the participants expressed positive perceptions of the SECF technology. Drawing from our findings, we offer valuable implications and recommendations for educators and researchers in the field, enhancing their understanding of the role of SECF technology in supporting intercultural competence development in tele-collaborative settings.\",\n",

Students' English proficiency and their attitudes toward the bilingual education programs were investigated. A mixed-methodological approach was used to better understand the efficacy of bilingual education programs. Both quantitative and qualitative results suggested that the bilingual education model successfully enhanced students' level of English proficiency. However, the mastery of subject knowledge in the bilingual education program was questioned. Students' English language ability appeared to be the strongest predictor associated with learning outcomes in the bilingual course.

The present study performed hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to bridge this research gap. This study invited 492 EFL teachers and 112 school administrators from 71 schools in Taiwan to participate in this survey. The research instruments include the TPACK scale for EFL teachers' TPACK and the diffusion of innovation (DOI) questionnaires to assess the DOI at the school level. The four-stage HLM indicated that a cross-level analysis was appropriate, and the three elements of TPACK significantly affected TPACK. The contextual factor of DOI was found to be significantly influential in the TPACK of EFL teachers. Such an effect was negatively related to the technological knowledge of the EFL teachers; however, it was not significantly related to their pedagogical and content knowledge. The possible reasons are discussed accordingly followed by theoretical and practical implications entailed in this study.\",\n",

       " 'Unmet demand for tertiary education is difficult to define and to estimate. In this report, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2001 Survey of Education, Training and Information  Technology are used to shed light on defining and enumerating unmet demand. Unmet demand occurs when potential students apply for a place at university or in the vocational education and training (VET) sector and their application is unsuccessful. It also occurs when potential students are discouraged from applying because their preferred course was  not available, had limited places or was perceived to be highly competitive. The report finds that unmet demand at a general level (ability to obtain any place) in 2001 was very low at 16,000 or 1% of total applications, but considerably higher in terms of getting a place in a preferred course at a preferred institution (10% of total applications, or 175,000). A potential difficulty with these figures could be that they are understated. This is based on the widely acknowledged understanding that some individuals are not applying for courses because  they assume that their applications will be unsuccessful. However, the data do not support that this is the case. That is, the estimates of unmet demand noted above are not understated. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)

       " 'This paper primarily discusses the challenges deaf students in Ghana are likely to grapple with as they access education provided for them in English language. The arguments discussed in this paper are supported by findings from a multiple site case study of five Schools for the Deaf purposively sampled from four regions of Ghana. Observations were made of 15 classroom teaching and learning processes at the basic school level. Interviews were also conducted with seven teachers to gather qualitative data for the study. The findings were that deaf students in Ghana access education, provided for them in their classrooms and textbooks, in much the same ways as their hearing counterparts whereas they do not have the same abilities as their hearing counterparts to effectively acquire and use English language. The poor access to English language as well as the limitations in technology developed for deaf students in Ghana reflect in some learning difficulties. This stagnation stifles the educational advancements of deaf students in Ghana. It is recommended that the Special Education Division of the Ghana Education Service should look into the language policy for deaf students and give, in the interim, concessionary passes in English language to enable deaf students qualify into higher institutions of learning.',\n",

       " 'The mid- to late 1990s was an exciting time for those concerned with incorporating new technology into their teaching of English as a second or foreign language (ESL/EFL). Commonly referred to as Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL), or sometimes with the broader term Technology-Enhanced Language Learning (TELL), the field took huge leaps forward during these years. This article focuses on one perhaps lesser-known approach to using technologies in the classroom that was created during this time and that is especially useful for ESL/EFL teachers to consider. The authors describe the model, explain its significance, and then provide activity ideas that teacher educators can use when incorporating the model into professional development workshops or in-service trainings.

During the pandemic, online learning was the ideal choice for continuing education, particularly in tertiary education. The purpose of this study is to identify the issues and hurdles that English language learners (EFL) have when transitioning to online learning in the second semester of 2020 because to the COVID-19 epidemic. This study's contribution is to analyse learners' new experiences in online education and to examine the practicality of virtual ways of learning. The study discovered that the primary issues influencing and impacting online EFL learning during COVID-19 are technological, academic, and communication concerns. This study focuses on the obstacles and variables that influence the acceptability and usage of E-Learning as a teaching tool in higher education. As a result, it will aid in the development of a strategic plan for the effective implementation of e-learning, as well as the acceptance of technology as a good step toward evolution and transformation.\",\n",

       " \"Although educators can use digital tools to meet emergent bilingual students' unique needs, language teachers generally feel unprepared to use technology with students, and language teacher education programs face challenges in implementing technology. This study uses ethnographic methods to explore 12 pre-service teachers' (PSTs) experiences learning about digital tools in ways intended to support emergent bilingual students. I interviewed the PSTs and observed their participation across student teaching and a concurrent practicum course, and I analyzed these data through the lens of activity theory. PSTs perceived that their participation in teacher education was characterised by a shared responsibility where all the PSTs, their teacher educator, and mentor teachers contributed new knowledge about digital tools. The co-construction of knowledge afforded the PSTs opportunities to learn in the moment, and many described their learning as 'playing around'. This study has implications for teacher education programs and theory related to teacher learning. Through shared responsibility and playfulness, all educational stakeholders can take on roles as learners and experts where they leverage one another's experiences and contributions to support PSTs' instructional practices, challenging traditional roles between PSTs and their multiple mentors.\",\n",
       " \"This research compared the process of disciplinary literacy acquisition of students who experienced two different pedagogical approaches to learning science, technology, engineering and mathematics through astronomy (STEM-A). The objective of this study was to explore the impact of a digital storytelling (DST) educational technology intervention in a STEM-A context on the process of disciplinary literacy acquisition of students who were learning English as a foreign language (EFL). The research was designed as a type IV case study with a sample of 30 students from Kyrgyzstan aged between 12 and 16\\xa0years. Data were collected from written responses to the astronomy diagnostic tests (ADT), which were coded against the structure of the observed learning outcomes (SOLO) and analysed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures on the occasion of testing. Data from the Australian sample, native speakers of English, (N = 328) were used as a baseline. The results showed a positive effect of the DST intervention on EFL students' astronomy disciplinary literacy acquisition. The research contributes to the body of knowledge on educational technology by exemplifying how the DST teaching intervention could bridge the gap between EFL and non-EFL students' disciplinary literacy acquisition in STEM areas.\",\n",

The evaluation used a random research design to estimate the overall effects of welfare-to-work programs in the following states: Georgia, Ohio, Michigan, Oklahoma, Oregon, and California. The study focused on the following issues: the quality of the education services provided; the extent to which welfare recipients participate in education and earn education credentials; the value of the education services provided; and the value of basic skills and education credentials in the labor market during the mid-1990s. The following were among the key findings: (1) even when welfare recipients preferred not to enter adult education, welfare-to-work programs  substantially increased their receipt of such education; (2) assignment to education-focused programs did not generally appear to have substantial payoffs for welfare recipients in terms of education outcomes; and (3) earning a General Educational Development (GED) certificate, increasing basic skills, or subsequently participating in postsecondary programs yielded substantial benefits in terms of employment, earnings, and self-sufficiency.

       " 'Being a teacher is much more that delivering contents in the classroom. It implies setting standard behaviors as well as showing ways to work. In one word, teachers are an example in the classroom. The implementation of their way to teach will be considered as good or bad teaching by their own students for many years. Likewise, the way they use technology in the classroom can trigger motivation and perceptions in their future students. That is why, teachers need to be conscious of what they do in the classroom and adopt technology principles to be applied in a near future.

The purpose was to identify the perspectives and actions of the school\\'s mathematics specialist and the multi-graded (grades 2-3) classroom teacher as they attempted to deliver instruction with technology for both English Language Learners (ELL) and non-ELL students. Findings showed that a critical factor in access to mathematics education and technology for ELL students in a multi-graded 2-3 classroom in a Title I (K-5) school setting was \"language.\" Although potentially powerful technologies--analog (concrete objects) and digital (software) were used, many ELL students could not access the content solely because of language difficulties. Teachers used the concrete objects as modeling tools, to reveal students\\' thinking, and for communication of foundational mathematics. Conversely, the software used served none of these functions because the available software did not do the kinds of things the manipulatives did, teachers\\' knowledge of exemplary software was insufficient, the school used an impoverished model of technology integration, and teachers were constrained by the school district\\'s policies of English immersion for ELL students.',\n",
       " 'Many emerging economies are just beginning to consume digital content meaningfully. In the field of education in particular, such technology could help to narrow the gap between teacher training and the expectations of a post-colonial, post-apartheid education system in an emerging economy. However, it is important that the use of technology in education be guided by sound pedagogical principles. Digital storytelling is not a new concept and is now part of the academic mainstream. It is increasingly recognised for its contribution to reflective practice, essential for professional development. This qualitative research aimed to introduce postgraduates to the value of reflective practice through digital storytelling. The study is located in a social constructivist paradigm. Data was collected through digital stories, individual written reflections, and focus group reflections. Data analysis involved coding, categorising and the identification of emerging themes. The findings established that pedagogical knowledge alone cannot prepare teachers to offer meaningful learning opportunities for all learners. Digital storytelling, however, can be incorporated in teacher training programmes in order to foster a culture of reflective practice for professional development.',\n",

During the process of implementing the new English education policy, the Ministry of Education (MOE) of Taiwan encountered several problems. Although researchers have examined other issues concerning the implementation of the English education policy, such as the shortage of trained English teaching personnel, the selection of textbooks and the difficulty of teaching a class of heterogeneous learners, parental attitudes toward or expectations for the English education policy itself remain unexplored. Parental opinions about English education and the extent to which parents support English education reform play a large role in the success of the implementation of the policy and are important factors for the government to consider when shaping future education policies. The perspectives of parents, therefore, should be included in a research-based examination. This study surveyed the opinions of Taiwanese parents on current English education policy and practice.

The volume is divided into two parts: Part One: Governance and the Knowledge Economy, focuses on how the discourses of a Knowledge Economy and Lifelong Learning, and an emerging functional and scalar division of the labour of educational governance became central to the development of a European Education Space. Contributors emphasise the role of the European Commission, and especially the Lisbon agenda, in this process, and considers the role of the Open Method of Coordination and the Bologna Process in the construction of the EES. A key theme linking Europeanisation to globalisation is the prominence of the discourse of competitiveness, and the role allocated to education in enhancing Europe's ability to compete with the United States and Japan. Part Two: Citizenship, Identity and Language, looks at the emergence of a new social model for Europe, this time from the point of view of how it relates the development of individual capacities and citizenship, and the role of intellectuals in this process. A second major theme is the place, role and choice of languages and at the impact of pressures from globalisation and Europeanisation, and national and sub-national levels, on language choice and teaching, taking into account both &quot;World Englishes&quot; and Language Europe. Finally, globalisation becomes the central issue in an analysis of its different relationships with &quot;northern&quot; (of which European education policy is taken as the example) and &quot;southern&quot; paradigms of educational development.

It allows the learner to hear multiple native English speakers talk in normal speed in a variety of accents. It also allows students to encounter new terms, expressions, and geographical locations. Radio is highly portable and relatively inexpensive. This paper addresses the advantages and disadvantages of using the radio, how radio propagation works, and suggestions for using the radio in the ESL classroom. The Internet and the World Wide Web have many advantages over radio use such as speed, interactivity, specialized site and chat room offerings, and other advantages, but these  advantages are moot if this technology is out of reach for financial reasons for many who wish to learn English.

While providing quality education in rural Malaysia has always been a challenge, little is known of the status of English language education in rural schools. The recent information provided by the United Nations Human Development Index website shows Malaysia's rural population is about 23% of the total population of 32 million. Thus, this paper examines published peer-reviewed research articles concerning English education in rural schools to determine the current status, and future needs of rural English education. This review not only highlights the dearth of research in this area but also examines how the current reform initiated for English language education in Malaysia affects rural schools. The findings also reveal that persistent issues such as lack of interest and need to use English among rural students, poor infrastructure and limited resources in schools, and lack of parental support in assisting school work at home remain as major challenges for improvement in English education. The findings also show that published school-based research was generally random studies carried out by independent researchers. Thus, none of the studies in this review reported any planned and coordinated intervention programmes by the Ministry of Education to improve rural English education. While more research is needed, supporting and encouraging critical analysis of current educational practices and policies is vital for ensuring better development and improvement for English education in rural schools.\",\n",

However, many teachers feel unsure about how to teach pronunciation at all, and the idea of using computers, mobile devices, or other technology may make pronunciation teaching seem doubly intimidating. If we look at technology from a different viewpoint, focusing first on the pedagogical tasks that teachers need to perform and then choosing the most effective tools to support each one, we can achieve better results for both teachers and learners. Based on both research and the classroom practice of experienced teachers, this article evaluates a range of available tools to accomplish tasks such as providing a pronunciation model, recording and responding to learners' pronunciation practice, and offering independent practice. The focus is on tools that are readily available to most classroom teachers, practical to learn and use, and free or inexpensive.\",\n",

       " 'Utilizing a framework which employs symbolic capital and post-colonial analysis, this paper examines the cultural meanings of English-language education at Cathedral and John Connon School in Bombay, India. The central question this article seeks to address is how power is replicated through education and, more specifically, the ways in which formerly British colonial systems of education are maintained as markers of success and prestige in urban India. This research draws upon intensive participant observation and interviews with teachers, students and parents at Cathedral and John Connon School in Bombay, as well as upon the extensive academic literature on English-language education in India. The discussion of how the politics of language and class intersect in education is divided into three topic areas: class and access to English-language education; the rural/urban divide; and the implications of English as an agent of global hegemony.',\n",

       " 'Demographic surges and economic growth have created an exploding demand for higher education in the Global South--a demand that low- and middle-income countries cannot realistically meet with traditional institutions alone. In India, the demand increasingly is being met by online education. Recently, MOOCs--with their potential to scale up rapidly at low marginal cost--are increasingly popular, primarily for professional training. The focus of this paper is to explore how this solution may play out, using data on enrollees in MOOCs in India. The picture that seems to be emerging in India is one in which MOOCs are able to fill in some of the gaps of an underperforming higher education system and provide opportunities that students are eager to employ. However, the fact that so many of the Indian MOOC students have already passed through the Indian higher education system suggests that MOOCs are not primarily a higher education tool--but rather, mostly serve professional-training needs. MOOCs hold the promise of filling at least some part of the gap between demand and the quality of education for students from the Global South. In those areas, MOOCs can be a critical part of the education landscape where a mix of online, private, and public education can comprise a diverse ecosystem of educational options. A list of resources is included.',\n",

       " 'The purpose of this study was to examine non-native English speaking students&apos; activity in face-to-face versus online learning environments. The amount of foreign students in the United States increased by 3% in the academic year 2009-2010 (Open Doors, 2010). Adding close to $20 billion to the USA economy, &quot;higher education is among the United States&apos; top service sector exports&quot; (Open Doors, 2010, ¶ 13). Globalization and &quot;academic mobility&quot; (Guruz, 2011, p. 20) need a common language. English has developed as lingua franca for higher education (Bjorkman, 2011; Ferguson, Perez-Llantada, &amp; Plo, 2011; Kaur, 2010; Matsuda &amp; Friedrich, 2011). The social and economic globalization as well as new technology influence education. This research is embedded in multiple fields, the global environment and &quot;academic mobility&quot; (Gurutz, 2011, p. 20), trends and requirements in education, and intercultural communication and languages. The researcher chose a mixed method approach to address the multiple dimensions of this topic. Four research questions and two hypotheses evaluated the activity of non-native English speakers in English based courses. The researcher observed and collected data in online and face-to-face courses. This researcher had the unique opportunity to observe two graduate courses with the same topic (Statistical Data Management), one online and one face-to-face, taught by the same instructor in the same semester. Participants were graduate students and included native and non-native English speakers. The findings of this study indicate that the activity of non-native English speakers increases in the online environment compared to the face-to-face education environment. Asynchronous online education offers advantages, especially for non-native English speakers. Nevertheless, non-native English speaking students preferred face-to-face courses for higher education. Higher education must find ways to motivate students toward new ways of education to teach global skills. Global education should balance content, pedagogy, technology, and culture. This study provides recommendations for those in international higher education to engage students actively in English-based education independent of their native language. The goal is to incorporate the rich opportunities of international diversity for all students, and to contribute to the education of global citizens.

       " \"Research on the roles of textbooks in EFL teaching contexts has been widely reported. However, studies on textbook adaptation strategies in a technology-integrated classroom have not received much attention. To fill the gap, the current research sought to explore the types of textbook adaptation strategies employed by an Indonesian EFL teacher in a technology-integrated teaching environment. The challenges encountered and the coping strategies used by the teacher were also investigated. Through a qualitative case study design, an English teacher of an Islamic junior high school in Medan was purposively recruited as the participant. An interview and document analysis were employed to collect the data. The interview data were analyzed using a thematic analysis while the documents were through skimming, reading, and interpretation. The findings revealed that the teacher employed several adaptive strategies, such as omission, addition, and modification on the assignments, the language skills, student activities, and approaches (conventional to the technologybased classroom) through the use of websites, a projector, and digital tools. It was also found that adapting the textbook was challenged by the varied students' levels of proficiency and learning styles, as well as the students' expectations of the teacher. As the coping strategies, the teacher optimized her skills of technology literacy to design creative and engaging learning materials and included tasks that met the levels of students from low and high-achieving groups. The findings of this study imply the crucial roles of all education stakeholders in providing support for teachers to use textbooks effectively.\",\n",
       " \"The role of internet technology in higher education and particularly in teaching English as a Foreign language is increasingly prominent because of the interest in the ways in which technology can be applied to support students. The automated evaluation scoring system is a typical demonstration of the application of network technology in the teaching of English writing. Many writing scoring platforms have been developed and used in China, which can provide online instant and corrective feedback on students' writing. However, the validity of &quot;Aim Writing,&quot; a product developed by Microsoft Research Asia, which claims to be the best tool to facilitate Chinese EFL learners, has not been tested in previous studies. In this mixed methods study, the feedback and effect of &quot;Aim Writing&quot; on college students' writing will be investigated and compared to the instructor's feedback. The results indicate that &quot;Aim Writing&quot;'s performance is insufficient to support all students' needs for writing and that colleges should encourage a hybrid model that contains both AES and instructor's feedback in writing.\",\n",

Despite the fact that these devices are available to teachers and learners, the traditional style of classes is still the dominant style. This research explores the utilization of mobile applications in traditional classroom settings, and how this affects students' learning and engagement. An action research project was conducted in Bahrain to study the differences between the utilization of mobile applications in a classroom setting in a private school, with more technology exposure, and in a public school, with limited technology exposure. The study found that the use of mobile applications in classrooms increased students' engagement despite differences in the utilization of technology.

This research aimed to identify the students' needs based on goals, necessities, wants, and lacks in learning the English language in Maritime Affairs and Fisheries School using the mixed method with sequential explanatory strategy. Through the purposive sampling, thirty students of the department of fisheries product processing technology at Sekolah Usaha Perikanan Menengah (SUPM) Negeri Sorong became the participants for this research. The recent research used a mixed-method design through a sequential explanatory strategy. Data collection instruments were Guttman scale questionnaires and Focus Group Discussion (FGD.

The research conducted the FGD to have a more in-depth explanation gathered from the questionnaires' answers. The results showed that ESP material needed by the students of the fisheries product processing technology department was English learning material related to fisheries product processing technology used when having a job. Students were expected to learn ESP topics such as the captain duties, shipping, fisheries, operating machinery, fisheries conversations, cook term, and other English materials correlated with the department of fisheries product processing technology. Therefore, the recent study implied that the teacher must provide ESP material suited to the students' major other than general English to meet the student's need for future work.\",\n",

       " \"Private educational activities designed to enhance student outcomes outside the formal schooling system are increasingly referred to as shadow education. In Japan, shadow education traditionally consists of for-profit cram schools or &quot;juku.&quot; &quot;Juku&quot; take many forms in Japan, yet their primary function is to offer students extra educational opportunities. As such, there is a strong belief that investment in shadow education leads to a higher educational level, thereby strengthening educational inequality by unfairly advantaging families of higher socio-economic status (SES). By applying Pierre Bourdieu's theories of social reproduction and symbolic violence, this study seeks to elucidate the extent to which neoliberal policies and a lack of guidance from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) have allowed shadow education in Japan to sustain anti-meritocratic access to higher education. The study critically analyses how laissez-faire policy-making decisions, a reliance on &quot;juku&quot; attendance, and an emphasis on English language as a test subject operate in conjunction with neoliberal policies to disadvantage lower SES families through uneven access to educational opportunities.\",\n",

       " 'The new geological epoch, the Anthropocene reveals the negative impacts of human activities on the environment, which makes environmental education significant to deal with the negative effects of people on the environment and sustain the environment for the future of the world. As a branch of education, English language teaching (ELT) can contribute to environmental education in schools. For an effective environmental education in ELT, English language teachers should have enough knowledge on environmental issues and environmental awareness. One way for them to achieve this is preservice English language teacher education. The literature review indicated that any English language teacher education program (ELTEP) was not evaluated with an anthropocentric perspective. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the new ELTEP of Turkey with an anthropocentric perspective. It was designed as a qualitative study. The data was collected from the new ELTEP of Turkey and was content analyzed. The findings of the study have shown that environmental education is integrated with the new ELTEP through community services and sustainable development and education courses.

As a result, instructors and learners were convinced to pursue their objectives despite the complications of pandemic disease. To this end, this study focuses on the effect of extra-curricular collocation-based assignments on reading comprehension skill and the utilization of technology in the context of education. Thus, in this quasi-experimental study two homogeneous groups including sixty intermediate students from a state university in Turkey were selected. Reading comprehension instruction was given to both groups who participated in online education run by a Moodle Application.While the experimental group received additional collocation-focused education and assignments, the control group had traditional reading comprehension education without noticing the importance and conducive effect of collocations. To compare the means of the two groups pre and post-tests, and two independent T-tests were used. Ameaningful difference in the means of the groups on the post-test of reading comprehension performance was obvious in the results section. Last but not the least, assignment, as an academic extra-curricular activity, had a considerable impact on Turkish intermediate EFL learners' foreign language reading comprehension ability after the pandemic lockdown period.\",\n",

       " \"Web based writing platforms allowing for exchanges across the world are increasingly being used in education. These recent forms of textual practice are highly related to conditions offered by the technology, allowing users, who previously were primarily consumers, to become producers of text. This chapter investigates student interaction over a blog in an intercultural student exchange between native speakers and nonnative speakers of English in higher education analysing and interpreting poetry. The groups of students involved in this study belong not only to different academic disciplines, but also differ in terms of nationality and language background. In the blog posts, the students' cultural voices are heard, offering a meeting between very contrasting groups. Scrutinising the student postings, the threaded discussions show ways that students thematise content and meaning in the poems. The results show that there are a number of features at play in an intercultural environment where language and translation issues are prominent parts of the student discussions, offering extended perspectives to the students' initial views. Collaborative efforts in such a diverse environment are important when negotiating meaning and extending students' understanding of poetry.

Moreover, this study aims to investigate prospective language teachers' attitudes towards inclusive education and their suggestions to make inclusive language education practices successful. The participants of the study were a total of twenty 4th year prospective English language teachers. A questionnaire consisting of 8 open-ended questions was given to the participants to gather data. The responses were examined one by one and interpretational approach was used to determine the categories and themes. Four main themes were generated. These themes were knowledge about inclusive education, professional competence, teachers' attitudes towards inclusion and disability, and things to do. The findings showed that although the majority of the participants knew the meaning of inclusive education, only few of them described the detailed process of inclusive education. This study also revealed that although most of the prospective language teachers did not have enough expertise and skills for teaching students with learning difficulties, they had positive attitudes towards inclusive language education. Prospective language teachers also expressed the necessity of pre-service trainings on inclusive education.\",\n",

Thus, using technology in language instruction has increasingly been recognized as a potential approach for addressing these constraints. This study uses administrative data from a large public university in Mexico to examine the impact of a technology-enhanced blended program on students' English course grades and course completion rates. Specifically, we focus on a campus-wide policy change in all compulsory English language courses that replaces half of the traditional face-to-face class time with an interactive online learning environment developed by a leading technology-mediated English language learning and assessment provider. Our results suggest that, compared to traditional face-to-face instruction, blended learning had a significant, positive impact on students' course grades and course completion rates. In addition, the enrollment-teacher ratio increased after replacing half of the face-to-face instructional time with online learning, suggesting that blended learning environments hold promise for providing high-quality and cost-effective language instruction.\",\n",

       " \"This paper discusses a qualitative study which examines the complexity and potential of using Synchronous Computer Mediated Corrective Feedback (SCMCF) for adult learners in English as a Second Language (ESL) classrooms in Sri Lanka. Chat conversation was assumed as the medium through which the teacher provides corrective feedback to the students. Five ESL teachers were interviewed for the study. The data gathered were analysed qualitatively using an affinity diagram which is discussed under an inductive thematic analysis. Findings of the study suggest that there is potential for provision of SCMCF through chat conversations, for teachers believe that SCMCF will improve language skills of the students; moreover, this approach needs only a limited use of technology. However, it was revealed that there could be some complexities, mainly due to teachers' existing workloads, some ethical aspects, and the low level of technology that is available in certain universities.

       " \"The rapid integration of technology in EFL learning and teaching requires competent EFL teachers to use Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) in their classes. Hence, the role of CALL teacher education in preparing competent EFL teachers is significant. However, conducting CALL teacher education is not without challenges. Given the importance of examining these challenges, the purpose of the current study was to investigate Iranian EFL teacher educators' voice about the challenges of conducting CALL teacher education programs. To that end, eight Iranian EFL teacher educators' biographical narratives were analyzed to obtain challenges concerning CALL teacher education. The thematic analysis of the narratives, based on the principles of ethnography semantics, indicated that challenges such as inertia, ignorance of training CALL educators, insufficient time to address CALL compared to other topics, insufficient infrastructure, insufficient standards, and lack of established methodology to administrate CALL teacher education were among the main obstacles of conducting CALL teacher education in the Iranian context. Moreover, the findings revealed that lack of EFL teachers' motivation to participate in such programs, insufficient CALL infrastructure in schools and institutes, and EFL teachers' inertia were other challenges in CALL teacher education. The findings suggest that the stability of CALL can be reached by removing the challenges of CALL teacher education if policy-makers address issues such as the required budgets, CALL infrastructures, and teacher motivation in CALL teacher education.\",\n",
       " 'Technology integration in education, how to do it effectively, how to help teachers gain the necessary competencies are among the most discussed topics in recent years. It is also known that in-service teacher training is full of problems and the desired outcomes cannot be achieved easily. Teacher training programs cannot equip future teachers with the required technological competencies. Reverse Mentoring Model suggested in this study is thought to help both pre- and in-service teachers to gain technopedagogical knowledge. By restructuring the teaching practice process, one of the most important components of teacher education programs, pre-service teachers, more equipped with technology knowledge, will mentor their in-service teacher during the teacher practice process, creating an environment in which both group of teachers will be learning from each other. The digital pool that will be developed as the output of the proposed model will include digital materials aligned with the curriculum.',\n",
       " \"Recent discussions in language communication indicate the effectiveness of technology and computer-mediated communication. Research also highlights the central role of synchronous and asynchronous modes of interaction in second and foreign language development. Gaining insights from Vygotskyan sociocultural theory of mind, the present study employed a mixed methods approach to explore the effect of synchronous computer-mediated corrective feedback on EFL learners' grammatical knowledge development. The participants were 40 Iranian EFL learners selected through a grammar-based pretest. Employing Skype software, the experimental group (N=20) was exposed to online text-based chatting. The purpose was to provide the participants with online technology-based corrective feedback on their grammatical errors. However, the control group (N=20) did not receive technology-enhanced corrective feedback during the experiment. The results highlighted: (a) the technology-enhanced, experimental group outperformed their counterpart with regard to grammatical accuracy, (b) the online Skype-based text chatting context played a mediating role in reinforcing the experimental group's grammatical knowledge, and (c) the participants displayed a high level of motivation to initiate and engage in L2 communication. The participants' experience of the Skype-based classroom emphasized themes of overcoming emotional problems in communication and fostering interpersonal relationship and rapport with the teacher and peers. Pedagogical implications focus on the potential of synchronous computer-mediated communication-based contexts as useful spaces for active collaborative learning and task engagement.\",\n",

We argue and demonstrate that a complex and ambivalent hegemony that has been operational since the colonial times, continues to shape English education in India. Today, English and English education play a major role in articulating, binding and dividing multiple identities and knowledge systems. In the first part of the paper, we critically review debates and discussions on the significance of English language education in institutes of higher education in India. Specifically, we focus on discourses on the rationale behind continuing and contesting English education. The second part examines how in the postmodern context, English is being taught differently to different groups and highlights how these contexts of teaching have been defining knowledge systems, patterns of dominance and also, articulating resistance.',\n",

The challenge for the Moroccan legislator, now and then, is to institutionalize the practice of education through mediated forms of technology, thereby encouraging both teachers and students to integrate technology in their teaching and learning practices. While adopting a qualitative case study method, this article highlights the experience of 113 students of a Moroccan English department with distance learning during the COVID-19 lockdown. Four themes emerged from the dataset: uncertainty, technical and logistical hurdles, inequality, and lack of intimacy. Though this research takes as its case study an example of an experience rather than a unique experience, it has international relevance in considering students' experience, which can help improve and maximize the application of distance learning and teaching in places with the same conditions such as Morocco.\",\n",

       " \"Language teaching can be enhanced by effective uses of technology; nonetheless, there are teachers who are reluctant to integrate technology in their practice. The debated issue has resulted in a number of Ministries of Education worldwide, including the Greek Ministry, to support a transition through the introduction of Interactive Whiteboards (IWBs). This initiative was not well-received in either the public or private sector, due to the fact that teachers were not provided with any training in how to use IWBs and include them in their teaching. IWBs became intimidating to the language teacher and did not serve their intended purpose in most cases. Nonetheless, there were teachers who were intrigued by IWBs and made an effort to apply them. The present paper focuses on the development of interactive language learning and the effect the teachers' risk-taking has on pedagogy from the teachers' and students' perspectives. The outcomes of the study were that language teachers have taken charge of their own professional growth and take risks in order to help learners benefit from IWBs. However, due to lack of training, teachers and students have not reached the zenith of using IWBs. [For the complete volume of short papers, see ED572005.]\",\n",

The early interest in integrating computer technology (CT) into the educational process approximately started in the 1950s. Yet, from the 1980s forward, the idea started to occupy a noticeable position in research and application. This in turn has led to significant developments in the educational system as a whole in terms of the teaching approaches, methodologies, and learning strategies. It has also stimulated more research and exploration of the potentials of utilizing CT within the teaching-learning process in general, and teaching languages in particular. Both theoretical and empirical evidence have testified to the effectiveness of CT in enhancing the teaching-learning process through various multimedia ( Krause 2008; Mustafa 2008; Oblender 2002; Teeter 1997; Edwards and Fritz 1997). CT has been showed to provide concepts, presentations, photographs, fixed drawings and animations as well as written texts, graphs, music, and other features, in a way which simulates real-life situations. This, in turn, stimulates the learners' activity, facilitates acquisition of knowledge, and helps in keeping and employing this knowledge in real life situations. All those contributions can lead to more learning, and give learning additional meaning and significance. In the realm of language learning, CT is used as a tool alongside other components and as a supportive or supplementary ingredient that helps language learners improve their four skills, thus creating a rich, active learning environment. The term used to express the process of using CT in learning languages is, Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL), which in turn constitutes a prominent feature within the blended learning approach (BLA). E-Learning was perhaps the first threshold of using modern technologies in the educational process. It came as a response to the deficiency of the dominant traditional teaching approaches on the one hand and the demand for new advancements on the other. In fact, the advent of e-learning brought out the teaching-learning process from its traditional structure and concept. Traditionally, the teacher was the determiner, the obtainer and the imparter of knowledge and the students' role was restricted to passive recipients of knowledge. E-learning brought to the teaching-learning process a broader and more progressive outlook; where the teacher has become an instructor, facilitator and planner while the learner became a researcher for information, hence, more active and effective in the teaching-learning process. The advancements of computer technology and the advent of Internet in the late 20th century had given e-learning the impetus to expand its tools and methods in communication and delivery. It had become the phenomenon of the era. People would be able to access a wealth of online information, to learn about an endless set of subjects and to improve their different skills. It has, therefore, changed the whole landscape of the teaching-learning environment by enabling learners to learn anywhere, at any time, and at their own pace, hence, overcoming place and time constraints. Nevertheless, E-learning is not absolutely optimal without flaws. Some educators had explored the e-learning approaches in depth and concluded that it suffers from a number of disadvantages and drawbacks. Their claims and arguments manifested the urgent need to new alternatives, which prompted the stakeholders to search for new approaches that combine the properties of both, the traditional learning and E-learning and, to overcome the deficiencies of both at the same time. The way therefore was paved for the emergence of the blended learning approach (BLA) which blends different forms of traditional learning with various varieties of E-learning. In this sense, the BLA created an innovative teaching-learning methodology that increased the effectiveness of the teaching-learning situation and offered new opportunities for the creation of an interactive learning environment. The main focus of this study is exploring the possibility of integrating computer technology in a more efficient way within the educational systems of Palestinian universities, particularly, the home institution of the researchers, Hebron University. But it is necessary prior to that to present a brief overview about CT status in the Palestinian educational institutions in general. One may argue that the usage of instructional technology within the Palestinian institutions is at its lowest levels. At the formal level, administrative authorities and educational policy makers are not giving the instructional technology in general and the BLA in particular the attention they deserve. Instructional technology and BL are not adopted in the educational system, nor are they implemented or funded to be implemented in any of the educational institutions.\",\n",
       " 'Aim/Purpose: The purpose of this exploratory case study was to understand how teachers, working with English Language Learners (ELLs), expanded their knowledge and instructional practices as they implemented a one-to-one iPad® program. Background: English Language Learners experience linguistic, cultural, and cognitive shifts that can be challenging, and at times lead to isolation for ELLs. While technology can be engaging, devices alone do not shift instructional practices, nor lead to student learning. Technology must be leveraged through shifts to pedagogical practice and linked thoughtfully to content goals. Methodology: This research was conducted through a qualitative case study of educators at an international school. Contribution: This study describes promising pedagogical practices for leveraging 1:1 mobile devices for ELLs. Findings: iPads can be a support for ELL students. One-to-one iPads allowed teachers to experiment with new pedagogical approaches, but this development varies greatly between teachers. During the 1:1 implementation there were challenges reported. Recommendations for Practitioners: In order to mitigate some of these challenges, and build on the success of this study, the researcher suggests developing a common vision for technology integration, using collaborative models of ELL teaching, and investing in professional development. Recommendation for Researchers: Researchers should continue to document and observe the learning outcomes of ELL students in 1:1 environments, including an experimental study. Impact on Society: ELLs can benefit from 1:1 technology, and new pedagogical practices. For teachers to implement these new practices conversations on philosophy, engagement with families, and consistent professional development. Future Research: Future research can continue to expand the population of ELL students in 1:1 mobile learning environments; and the most powerful pedagogical practices.',\n",

       " \"This article focuses on the work of three British Women Education Officers (WEOs) in Nigeria as the colony was preparing for independence. Well-qualified and progressive women teachers, Kathleen Player, Evelyn Clark (née Hyde), and Mary Hargrave (née Robinson), were appointed as WEOs in 1945, 1949, and 1950 respectively. I argue that the three WEOs endeavoured to reconcile their British cultural values, progressive education, English language instruction, and the intricacies of Nigerian cultures in order to prepare students for life and work in an independent Nigeria. Their roles were diverse, encompassing administration and teaching, teacher education, and leadership of girls' boarding schools and residential training colleges where English was the language of instruction. Following an outline of the WEOs' prior experiences, I compare and contrast their approaches to progressive education, beginning with Clark's endeavours to make girls' education &quot;a graft that would grow onto and into their own way of life&quot; at the Women's Training College, Sokoto, in far Northern Nigeria. Then I discuss Robinson's work in a men's elementary training college at Bauchi where she dispensed a &quot;down-to-earth practical&quot; progressive education to prospective primary school teachers. Finally, Player gave girls &quot;as complete an education as possible for life as a worker, wife and mother&quot; at Queen Elizabeth School, the first government secondary school for girls in Northern Nigeria. Each situation illustrates the complex social relations involved in realising WEOs' commitments to progressive education as an emancipatory project.\",\n",

The Malaysia Education Blueprint 2013-2025 has taken the initiatives to implement Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in learning in bid to cater to their learning styles. However, the implementation has not been smooth-sailing as most teachers have not been integrating ICT in their lessons seamlessly. Goldberg's (1981) Big Five Model of Personality can explain various usage of ICT based on their respective trait but TESL (Teaching English as Second Language) undergraduates in the Malaysian context had not been studied before. The researcher purposively selected 72 TESL undergraduates from the Faculty of Educational Studies in a public university in Malaysia for the study using a questionnaire and semi-structured interview. The findings reported high levels of ICT integration and motivation in integrating it. Next, they scored the highest in Openness to experience towards ICT integration in L2 teaching while low in Neuroticism. There was also a statistically significant, moderate, positive relationship between their level of motivation, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion and Openness traits and their ICT integration in L2 teaching.

       " \"Gamification becomes an important and widely used instrument in online learning, and it affects users' experience. However, recent research on the interaction between a user and technology, in the online learning platform, tends to study gamification separately. This paper aims to overcome the research gap, exploring the relationships between user engagement, platform affordances, and gamification in online learning. An online survey was conducted among the participants (N=375) studying with Skyeng (commercial online platform for learning English). The data was analysed with factor and regression analysis. The results demonstrated four major platform affordances: technology credibility and usability, adaptability of course tasks, phasing and intermittence and external reward. Among the four, technology credibility and usability was found to be the most influential predictor of user engagement in online learning. External reward, as an affordance, drawn from gamification elements, has the smallest contribution to user engagement. However, the study proves the suitability of perceiving gamified elements as affordances by platform users. The research provides conceptual and empirical grounds for studying gamification elements as one of the affordances in online learning and outlines further directions to explore these connections.\",\n",
       " \"Despite abundant research on educational technology and strategic input in the field, various surveys have shown that (language) teachers do not seem to embrace in their teaching the full potential of information and communication technology available in our everyday life. Language students soon entering the professional field could accelerate the process, which highlights the role of teacher education in contributing to the change. The students should see how technology development may change the affordances for language learning, at the same time transforming the teachers' professional roles and practices. However, taking an active role in designing a new kind of language pedagogy seems to be challenging for students. This study explores an attempt to facilitate the students' perspective switch from the teacher role to the designer position through participatory design. This effort was to lead the students to envision new practices for language learning and teaching with new technologies. However, initial analyses of the research materials indicated that, despite the support, the students were not fully able to see their role as designers for the future. Cultural-historical activity theory was used to examine the problem more closely. The analysis suggests that in order to position themselves as designers of the future language learning activity, language students need to understand their role as designers, conduct real-life experiments on the evolving visions with their learners, and involve learners as participants in the design activity by sharing visions and collaborative reflection on the experiments. The findings of the study provide tools for language teacher educators to make these activity systems visible and, thus, target for change.\",\n",

As mobile technology offers highly practical and portable usage for self-directed learning, studies on language learning practices through technology-based applications have become prevalent among adult learners. This study aimed to examine learners' digitalized self-directed language learning practices for enhancing their English language skills at the tertiary level. The study employed a mixed method design, and the data were collected from 182 EFL learners at a higher education institution in Türkiye. The data were analysed through descriptive statistics and content analyses. The results demonstrated that the majority of the participants use mobile phones besides computers and tablets. However, their level of frequency in using these digital devices in English signaled a low level. Furthermore, results in association with the self-directed practices of learners for improving language skills evinced distinct language learning practices supported by technology-mediated applications and platforms. It was also concluded that learners need a well-organised self-directed learning practice in digital platforms. The study addresses key attributes of practical implications adhering to digitalized self-directed language learning practices for more efficient outcomes in advancing language skills in EFL instruction.\",\n",

       " 'The question of whether educational technology can be of assistance to the public school teacher who is in the position of having to teach the rudiments of a second language that he himself has not mastered is addresed in this paper. A series of teaching and learning units were constructed and experimented with for two years in teaching English as a second language to 10- and 11-year-old students. The technology that was used allowed for a high degree of individualization of instruction, due particularly to the use of the cassette tape-recorder. The results show that the 10-year-old students performed better than a control group in a similar context. The instructional method used also seems to increase the motivation and enjoyment of the students in relation to English as a  school subject. However, the learning environment thus created retains a certain rigidity unless it is enlivened by a teacher capable of speaking the second language and promoting dynamic exchanges between students.

However, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of bilingual education in preschool. This study used multiple years of data from the Manchester (New Hampshire) Even Start program and relevant comparison groups to conduct two separate tests of the effectiveness of bilingual education in preschool. The results support the effectiveness of bilingual education in preschool, but only at marginally significant levels of statistical inference. A fixed effects model of literacy outcomes comparing a cohort of students who had received bilingual education in preschool but English-only education in kindergarten with a cohort of students who received English-only education in both preschool and kindergarten showed evidence of an achievement gap (favoring the students receiving bilingual education) that emerged at the end of preschool but had closed by the end of kindergarten (10 values ranged from 0.028 to 0.068). Also, an analysis of two years of preschool data from an Even Start program that utilized bilingual education in the first year, but not the second, showed that Even Start students who did not receive bilingual education performed worse on posttest literacy assessments when controlling for pretest scores (p values ranged from 0.056 to 0.060). However, when estimated with a control group consisting of only English language learners, this negative effect was no longer significant. Although the study provides some evidence of the effectiveness of bilingual education in preschool, further research is needed to validate these findings. (Contains 5 tables.)',\n",

With a cross-sectional survey design approach, the study focuses on learner characteristics. It first investigates the existing language learner profiles of 512 English major university students concerning autonomous language learning and out-of-class technology engagement. Then, details regarding the characteristics of existing learner profiles in terms of language proficiency, daily technology use time, a variety of digital tool use and the most beneficial tools are outlined. Within this frame, cluster analyses suggested two clusters: more autonomously engaged with digital tools and less autonomously engaged with digital tools. The findings showed that more autonomously engaged students tend to have greater language learning proficiency than the less autonomous group. The more autonomously engaged students also spent more time daily and used various digital tools in comparison to less autonomous technology users. While online websites and social media were the most frequently used digital tools for both groups, the use of podcasts, blogs and online language courses differed. According to the provided tool lists of learners, students benefited significantly from social media, online websites, dictionaries, and intelligent tutoring system applications (apps). Online games, YouTube, Instagram and other smartphone apps, which allow students to practice vocabulary and speak with foreigners, also had considerable influence on language development.

       " \"The robust relation between maternal education and child language that is observed in monolingual populations has not been reliably replicated among bilingual children from immigrant families in the United States. We hypothesized that a variable that operates in immigrant populations--the language in which mothers achieved their highest level of education, is relevant to the benefits of maternal education to children's language growth. The participants were 92 U.S.-born bilingually developing children (47 boys, 45 girls) with native Spanish-speaking immigrant mothers. The mothers varied both in their level of education and in the language (English or Spanish) in which they had achieved their highest level of education. The children's expressive vocabulary in English and Spanish was assessed at 6-month intervals between 30 and 60 months. Four sets of multilevel models, which included estimates of children's relative amount of input in each language and mothers' age of arrival, found that maternal level of education in English was significantly related to children's English skill, but not their Spanish skill, and that maternal level of education in Spanish was related to children's Spanish skill, but not their English skill. These language specific relations between mothers' levels of education and their children's language development potentially explain previous findings in immigrant populations. These findings further argue that maternal education benefits children's language because education changes mothers' use of the language in which that education was achieved. There was no evidence of a language general benefit of education, as might arise from increased knowledge of child development.\",\n",

       " \"Purpose: Following education's recent and abrupt reliance on technology-mediated pedagogies, the novel coronavirus pandemic has, in many instances, highlighted the unpreparedness of learning institutions worldwide to implement effective online instruction. While practical quality considerations include content delivery, teacher training, equipment provision, and networked infrastructure, the situated and enculturated means by which online language education occurs represents a learner-focused factor that language educators may inadvertently neglect as they struggle to accommodate an emerging digital frontier. With this issue in mind, this paper aims to contribute to quality assurance in digital foreign language instruction by providing a sociocultural interpretation of CALL as learners and instructors alike continue to struggle within the boundaries of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: In focussing on learner equity, identity and interaction, the current conceptual paper draws attention to potential affective factors driving computer-assisted language learning (CALL) participation structures, providing sociological consideration of the potential impacts of digital language education and, in doing so, confront the deterministic notion that online language learning represents a general equaliser of hierarchical participation structures. Findings: Although CALL's dynamic nature does provide users with openings to revise linguistic, semiotic and social practices, a growing body of research contests the broad depiction of digital language learning as automatically strengthening learner equity and interaction. Euphoric visions of technology inexorably engendering positive outcomes thereby risk obscuring those sociocultural pressures that impact user identity and, thus, how diverse social actors interact within unfamiliar learning communities. Originality/value: This conceptual study is among a select few that focusses on CALL quality assurance during COVID-induced online education.\",\n",

The research sites were the applied foreign language departments of a university of technology and an institute of technology. The latter required day-division students to pass the first stage of the test's intermediate level or the school-administered make-up examination, whereas the former did not prescribe any General English Proficiency Test requirement.

       " 'Grounded in sociocultural models of learning, this study explores structures for participation and types of interaction that occur during the performance of technology-assisted tasks in a science classroom to detail some of the opportunities for learning made available to English learners (ELs) and some practices that might constitute effective instruction within such a context. In particular, this study explores how ELs use language to socialize and how they are socialized to use language during technology-assisted tasks in a science classroom within a given participant structure. Findings show that five different participant structures were used during technology-assisted tasks, all of which required ELs to understand and use varied interaction patterns; different levels of authority and responsibilities were given to interlocutors in each structure. As different participant structures employed different interactional patterns and practices, learners behaved according to differing norms expected by each participant structure. Findings showed that members of the class shared the rules regarding the initiation of interactions and open topics, as well as allowing time to listen and follow the cue of teachers or technology. In this sense, the class functioned as a community of practice (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991). Each participant structure appeared to contribute to the variety of the interaction types, as well as to kinds of subsequent learning and socialization of ELs, providing divergent levels of transparency, legitimacy, and peripherality to ELs. The integration of technology unfolded differently across participant structures and has implications for ELs&apos; academic language learning opportunities.

       " 'Migrant English as a Second Language (ESL) has been an important form of rural adult education in the United States for decades. This chapter provides a national and historical overview of rural and migrant ESL. The educational needs of the growing population of seasonal, migrant agricultural workers are discussed and situated in relation to the growth of adult education, literacy education, and ESL as professions in the United States. Then, the majority of this chapter describes and evaluates a migrant farmworker outreach and education program created at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and brought to migrant camps in Lenawee County in rural southeastern Michigan. This program, now in its tenth year, has had an important impact on both the university community and the Lenawee County organizations that serve the migrant farmworker populations there. The authors offer this account as a model for mutually beneficial collaboration among several groups of stakeholders who have provided migrant ESL and bilingual health and safety education to adults in rural areas in an era of continuing budget cuts for both adult education and  migrant education.',\n",
       " \"In this article I examine some challenges of assessing character education in the context of Teaching English as a Foreign Language in Indonesia (TEFLIN). Major sources of character education in Indonesia (e.g., &quot;Kurikulum&quot; 2013) seem to be religious values. However, there are two salient problems. First, in religiously inspired character education, there are concerns about religious values imposition. Second, it is oftentimes vague what types of, and how, character education can be evaluated in English language teaching and learning settings. In the context of an EFL teacher education program in a Christian university that I studied, one Christian student showed her religious dogmatism in classroom interactions or elsewhere in which peers having different religious views were present. Students' communicative competence in expressing religious values can be assessed by examining their growing self-reflexivity (which problematizes dogmatism), among others, in their discourse. Character education assessment rubrics are developed from the cases reported here, in light of: (1) the Indonesian government's guidelines for assessing character education; (2) critical ELT; and (3) Celce-Murcia's (2007) model of communicative competence.\",\n",

Integration of ICT into education is a fundamental issue. A quantitative research approach is applied. A web-based survey questionnaire has been developed. A sample of 35 English teachers from different primary schools around Bahrain has participated. Results of data show that the ICT is highly appreciated in primary Education. The English teachers have a positive attitude towards the application of ICT tools. However, they express their frustration as to the technical problems they often encounter as well as the time consuming for preparing ICT-based lessons. In general, the use of ICT in the primary education can be a fun tool and a strategy to be utilized for better learning and more enhancing environment.\",\n",

       " \"Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) for 4th Year EFL Student Teachers is a complementary language teaching methodology course, with a specific focus on computer-assisted language learning approaches, methods, techniques and procedures as well as the computer-based tools, devices, applications and facilities that can be used to facilitate language learning. With the dominant use of computer and Internet technologies nowadays, it has become necessary that our teaching methodology courses should be updated accordingly; they should include insightful guidance into how to teach English as a foreign language with the aid of computers and the web -- including laptops, tablets, and smart phones. The potential to enhance English learning through technology in general and computer-based tools, applications, devices and facilities in particular, has become increasingly a hot topic today. Practically speaking, the ability to use, merge and integrate technology--including computer and web-based tools--into the classroom is a core skill for English language teachers in the 21st century. From a literacy perspective, English language teachers need to cope with learners' new literacy practices (e.g. social networking, composing messages on mobile phones, using WhatsApp in daily communication, sharing resources online, etc.) in order to properly reach them. If teachers do not consider these new literacy practices in their teaching, a literacy gap will appear. The course is the first CALL course offered at Faculty of Education, Assiut university based on the new bylaws and regulations introduced in the academic year 2017/18. It introduces pre-service English teachers to CALL with the aim of focusing on the 'how to' aspect of integrating computer-based technologies into English language teaching and learning contexts. It takes into consideration the dialogic relationship and the complex interaction between language learning content (i.e., reading, writing, speaking, listening, vocabulary and grammar), pedagogy and language instruction (e.g., communicative language teaching and task-based approaches), and technology (i.e., affordances and constraints of different technological tools) with an awareness of the social and linguistic implications. In addition, the course aims to develop a hybrid CALL practitioner, developer, researcher, and trainer in this field. Thus, this course addresses TESOL fundamental concepts, knowledge, skills, and attitudes that enhance pre-service teachers' technological competencies and promote their integration of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) technology into English language-teaching settings and curriculum with confidence, knowledge, and practice. Therefore, the main goals of the course are represented in: (1) acquainting pre-service English language teachers with the foundational knowledge, competencies and skills in technology in general and computers and the Web in particular, for professional purposes; (2) developing pre-service EFL student teachers' theoretical understanding of the relationship between computers and the Web on one hand, and English language teaching/learning on the other; (3) expanding pre-service EFL student teachers' knowledge base in TESOL/TEFL to encompass new CALL theories, approaches, strategies, methods and techniques; (4) developing pre-service EFL student teachers' computer-based and language-related literacy practices; (5) exploring the possible application of computers and Web-based technologies in English language learning; (6) assisting pre-service EFL student teachers in using computer-based technologies and facilities in the classroom for a variety of language learning purposes; (7) integrating pedagogical knowledge and skills with technology to enhance language teaching and learning; and (8) applying technology and computer-based practices into instruction (e.g. record keeping, feedback, and assessment).\",\n",
       " 'It is true that mobile technologies are growing day by day and as part of they are becoming more and more integrated into everyday lives of people of all ages. One of the reasons of their growing popularity is because they serve different needs of individuals. Since mobile technologies have gained importance and become a powerful asset, different uses of them and their integration in education have become a question of many researches in the field. To have better communication and reach the new generation integrating technology to education programs is among these questions. More importance is attributed to technology enhanced teaching and learning activities than in the past. In this regard, as part of mobile technologies, social media has also become more significant. One of the descriptions of social media is platforms where students have constant access to information. Within the education context, it has become prominent that not only social media provides constant access to information, but it also supports students by allowing them to share content, collaborate and support learning. Therefore, again in the context of mobile technologies, by investigating the attitudes of students in higher education towards using social media for educational purposes, this study aims to develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding about their possible use in education. 202 university students formed the sample of this study. Descriptive survey design with a 5 point Likert survey and semi-structured interview were used for the study. The findings of the study suggest that students have a high opinion of social media use and support its use for educational purposes.',\n",
       " \"LEGO blocks have been played with by generations of children worldwide since the 1950s. It is undeniable that they boost creativity, eye-hand coordination, focus, planning, problem solving and many other skills. LEGO bricks have been also used by educators across the curricula as they are extremely motivating and engaging and, in effect, make learning effective. The toy has developed with time, as a result of technology impact as well as users' needs and expectations. This paper describes the transformation of the use of LEGO based activity in the academic writing class in the Institute of English Studies at the University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Warsaw, Poland spanning a period of the last seven years. Originally, the author's idea was just to illustrate in theory the principle of cohesion and coherence on the example of Lego composition instruction, a concept described by Joseph Williams; however, it evolved into a highly successful technology mediated task-based activity. The activity has been conducted since 2008 and in the author's newest 2014/15 version, it involves online writing, digital photography, computer editing programs, animation, e-learning tools and blogging; it boosts, apart from the above mentioned skills, writing, reading, teamwork and IT skills. Its teaching/learning success results also from its multimodality, learner empowerment and authenticity. Moreover, the case illustrates teacher development due to both external and internal class factors, including the impact of learners' competence and skills on the transformation of the activity itself and the resulting teacher training. Finally, the paper focuses on the role of the fast changing ICT technology in the development and adjustment of the English language learning task, the task based on the innovative use of Lego blocks in teaching academic skills to the students of the English studies program.\",\n",

It is paramount to understand to what extent such developments lead to accurate, comprehensive, and useful assessment of OC. In this paper, we discuss five models of technology-delivered OC assessment that have appeared in the past three decades. We evaluate these models in terms of how well their respective methods aid in assessing OC. To achieve this aim, we use a framework which takes into account a contemporary view of OC ability, including the call for incorporating English as a lingua franca (ELF) considerations into English language assessment. The evaluation of the five models suggests strengths and weaknesses of each that should be considered when determining which is used for a particular purpose.',\n",

       " \"The purpose of the project described here is to demonstrate how the introduction of subject matter and principles from citizenship education into foreign language education combines objectives from both in order to give meaning to language education on the one hand and extend citizenship education beyond a focus on the local and the national on the other. In doing so, the educational aims of foreign language teaching--as well as its instrumental purposes--can be met and the scope of citizenship education is extended to include intercultural citizenship. The project was located in Higher Education in Argentina, where 76 students were learning English, and in Britain, where 23 students were learning Spanish.

Data were collected then and comprise documentary data (posters, PowerPoints, videos, etc.) and conversational data (online communication between the Argentinian and British students using Skype). This article describes the processes of the project and the ways in which students reacted, particularly the Argentinian students who felt personally involved, and demonstrates how the combination of language and citizenship education, when given the additional viewpoint of an insider and outsider perspective, leads to significant developments in learners' lives: an identification with a transnational group and perspective, and a willingness to become directly and critically involved in action in the community.\",\n",
       " 'There is no doubt that formulaic expressions such as collocations, idioms and compounds play an important role in the second language acquisition and their teaching should be an integral part of foreign language learning since they show insights into foreign language culture and promote fluency, proficiency and communicative competence. That is the reason why idioms present an integral part of the English language curriculum at the Faculty of Food Technology and students are taught idioms related to food. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to establish whether the students are familiar with the food idioms prior to teaching them in order to incorporate them into the curriculum. The assumption is that most of the idioms are not intelligible to students since it is impossible to guess their meaning by analyzing their individual components. However, due to the fact that the subjects were the 1st year graduate students who have been learning English for 15 years, this research will reveal whether there are students who are almost proficient users of English since they are familiar with most of the idioms. These results will, then, be of great importance when revising and designing the teaching materials intended for the students of food technology.',\n",

To bridge this gap, the current study explored the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on TALiDE, the roles, and competencies underlying TALiDE, and whether technology needs to be considered in the conceptualization of AL. The data were collected from an open-ended questionnaire and a set of interviews investigating the perspectives of 27 participants (12 experts and 15 EFL teachers). The findings, inferred from content and thematic analyses of data, reflected teachers' raised awareness as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic experience, which resulted in an understanding of new approaches to assessment and increased value of TALiDE. Furthermore, compared to the existing literature on AL, roles and competencies underlying TALiDE corresponded to five main subthemes: teacher as a knower, implementer, confident technology user, moral agent, and learner. Finally, findings speculated a potential role for technology in the AL concept. This study can provide teacher trainers, educational policymakers, and course designers with implications for designing teacher development courses and programs to integrate TALiDE into their training practices.\",\n",

However, the wider question that lies in the relation between technology and translation is, What does technology do to language? This is an important question in the current paradigm because new translation technologies, such as, translation memories, data-based machine translation, and collaborative translation, far from being just additional tools, are changing the very nature of the translators' cognitive activity, social relations, and professional standing. In fact, in some translation situations such as when translating technical materials or subject matter that are not a specialization with human translators, one potentially needs technology. The purview of this paper, however, is limited to the role of MT in day to day situations where the generic MT tools like Google Translate or Bing Translator are encouraged. Further, it endeavours to weigh and empirically demonstrate the pros and cons of MT with a view to recommending measures for better communication training in the EFL set up of Saudi Arabia.\",\n",
       " \"Today's language classroom is vastly different from that of the mid- to late 20th century. The study is a meta-analysis of recent research which provided the means to identify current and emerging trends in the field. Informed by this research, some identified trends that are shaping the 21st century language classroom are outdated practices such as: (1) Vague, hollow promises that can't be proven; (2) Saying that learning languages is easy; (3) Authoritative teacher attitudes; (4) Complaining about cutbacks and lack of funding; and (5) Language labs. These are being replaced by newer approaches such as: (1) Clear, provable demonstrations of learning; (20 Frameworks, benchmarks and other asset-based approaches to assessment; (3) Individualized, customizable, learner-centred approaches; (4) Proving the value of language learning through stories and speech; (5) Using technology for language learning; (6) Linking language learning to leadership skills; and (7) Showing funders the impact their investment has on students and communities. In short, the focus in language education in the twenty-first century is no longer on grammar, memorization and learning from rote, but rather using language and cultural knowledge as a means to communicate and connect to others around the globe. Geographical and physical boundaries are being transcended by technology as students learn to reach out to the world around them, using their language and cultural skills to facilitate the connections they are eager to make. A list of references and resources is included. [This report has been published by Onate Press, an imprint of Eaton International Consulting Inc.]\",\n",

The basis of any meaningful development and the bedrock of a breakthrough whether in technology, industry, economy or communication in education. Therefore, language is also a good instrument of synergy toward growth. In African universities especially in Nigeria, dissemination of knowledge is done through bilingualism or multilingualism which is used to attain the broad goals of education.

       " \"In Education 5.0, teaching with Information &amp; Communication Technologies (ICT) is more than substituting old technologies like the blackboard with interactive boards. The use of technology is more of an enabler to add value and increase effectiveness to improve learning. Nevertheless, most teachers are still lacking on the know-how of technology in teaching-learning situations. Therefore, this study investigated the development of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge for twenty-first century learning skills (TPACK21cls) in the planned, delivered and experienced curriculums of a teaching programme for the Teaching of English as a Second Language in an Institute of Teacher Education (ITE) in Malaysia. The intersection of the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge framework is complemented with the Substitute, Augmentation, Modification and Redefinition (SAMR) Model to gauge the stages of ICT tasks created for communication, collaboration, critical thinking and creativity. Qualitative data methods include document analysis, interviews and reflections while data analysis was based on data reduction into themes through coding processes. The findings revealed that TPACK21cls was missing while Content Knowledge and Pedagogical Content Knowledge were emphasised in the planned curriculum. As for the developed curriculum, TPACK21cls was not explicitly delivered. Meanwhile the experienced curriculum displayed the participants possessing TPACK for communication at substitution stage. Additional findings reported were on upgrading ICT infrastructures, up-skilling lecturers' knowledge on ICT and revising the pre-service curriculum. The findings have implications for the teaching and learning with ICT in schools and ITEs which would be able to review the curriculum of teacher education programs to address TPACK21cls capabilities.\",\n",

The study aims to explore students' views of multicultural education in learning at an Indonesian Islamic higher education. It employs a descriptive study by applying a quantitative approach. By considering the ethnic and study program, respondents in this study were determined through the purposive sampling technique by involving 25 students from the Faculty of Tarbiyah and Teacher Training UINSI Samarinda, each representing five different study programs in the faculty. They enrolled as Ma'had Al-Jami'ah students obligated to study English in their initial semester. They were chosen from various study programs because they came from different ethnic backgrounds. This study collects data with a questionnaire instrument distributed online through a Google Forms. Descriptive statistics were used to tabulate and present the quantitative data collected from the questionnaire. The findings in this study provide an overview of the different perspectives of students at Islamic higher education on multicultural education in their learning. This study groups students' views of multicultural education in learning at Islamic higher education into three categories: (1) Highly Supportive on Multicultural Education; (2) Moderately Supportive on Multicultural Education; and (3) Lowly Supportive on Multicultural Education. Most of them have understood the values of multicultural education and are very supportive of its implementation in every lecture and campus policy but there are still students who do not understand the values of this multicultural education. Continuous studies are necessary to support the application of this multicultural education from time to time according to the needs of each institution.\",\n",
       " 'In this study enrolment numbers and levels, as well as language-in-education, were viewed from a linear, comparative perspective. In the era prior to 1994, black and white learners not only attended separate schools but the segregated schools had different policies regarding medium of instruction. Resistance to the language policy regarding black education culminated in the 1976 uprisings. This led to the scrapping of both Afrikaans and black home languages as language of instruction in black schools. After the uprisings, black schools followed a policy of decreasing bilingualism. After 1994, in the spirit of democracy, official and educational status were granted to eleven languages. Deep-seated distrust and fear, that home-language education would lead to impoverishment, social and political isolation, and disempowerment, caused the majority of South African learners to prefer English rather than their home language as language of instruction. From a linear comparison, it transpires that the language-in-education situation in the classroom has changed very little since 1994. Enrolment numbers and levels, particularly the disparities between white and black, were other points of criticism regarding the education system before 1994. Prior to 1994, compulsory education had only been fully implemented with regard to the white and, to a lesser extent, Indian and coloured sections of the population. The vision that the ANC had in 1955, that &quot;the doors of learning shall be open&quot;, was only reflected in policy documents and laws. Both primary-school and secondary-school enrolment numbers showed an increase after the ANC government came to power. The net enrolment numbers (1995-2004) for primary education showed a decrease from 95.0% to 87.4%, but the enrolment numbers for secondary education showed an increase from 56.0% to 67.2%. Despite the latter positive statistics, it would appear that the objective of universal education has still not been realised in South Africa.',\n",

The study consisted of three hours of task-based classroom instruction, complemented with one hour of additional class time, which was devoted to viewing and evaluating students' video recorded speaking tasks, assigned as homework. A mixed research method was used to collect data from multiple sources: recordings of a pre- and post-course speaking task, analysis of the video-recordings of students' speaking tasks, informal interviews with the students, and a written end-of-year course evaluation survey.  Analysis of quantitative and qualitative data revealed that students made noticeable improvement in their oral communication skills, and they were positive in their perceptions of integrating technology in the lesson. The study also indicated that the use of video camera, as a technological tool, had a positive impact on students' viewing and critically evaluating their speaking tasks. Attention is drawn to a number of potential advantages of integrating technology into face-to-face instruction, and it is suggested that video cameras represent a language learning resource worthy of further investigation.

To fill the gap in TPACK research in the EFL domain, this study aims to explore the TPACK among 22 in-service EFL teachers at elementary schools in Taiwan. Also, the possible needs of these EFL teachers for their future professional development were investigated. In order to better portray the TPACK of the EFL teachers, both their synthesized TPACK and performance on the seven TPACK construct components were evaluated in this study. A quantitative questionnaire was used to assess the EFL teachers' performance on the seven TPACK construct components. Their synthesized TPACK was revealed by means of interviews and classroom observations. The Revised Bloom's Taxonomy and the pedagogic framework for computer-assisted language learning were used to analyze the qualitative data collected from the interviews and class observations. The results indicated that the EFL teachers needed more technology knowledge to further develop their TPACK, and that the EFL teachers' TPACK focused much on motivating students, rather than on using technology for creating opportunities for students to use English language meaningfully and authentically.\",\n",

       " 'This essay traces the bilingual education movement that began in Tucson through the efforts of local teachers, university faculty and educational leaders. It is argued that Mexican Americans and their allies played a crucial role in promoting the merits of bilingual education at the local, state and national levels. Their advocacy of Spanish-for-Spanish-speakers programmes as a culturally relevant means of improving educational outcomes for Mexican American students led to a push for bilingual education with the support of the National Education Association. The work that educators from Tucson accomplished focused national attention on the education of Mexican Americans and ultimately contributed to the passage of the Bilingual Education Act of 1968. This legislation sparked a national movement to expand bilingual education programmes throughout the Southwest and other parts of the nation.',\n",
       " \"This paper presents a brief historical overview and summary of the various approaches and recent developments in the field of bilingual education. The controversy that exists with respect to the different approaches to bilingual education has prevented the development of national goals and guidelines and the preparation of adequate evaluation instruments. Educators are now striving to remove the stigma that bilingual education is only compensatory education for the disadvantaged. Efforts are being made to demonstrate the importance of establishing and maintaining bilingual programs. The Bilingual Education Act was enacted in 1968, and in 1974, educational amendments were introduced to authorize funding for the Bilingual Education Program so that its goals could be reached.  Considerable inroads have been made in the field of bilingual-bicultural education at the elementary and high school levels. However, institutions of higher education have been slower in providing equal educational opportunities. The second part of this paper focuses on a model developed at the college level which is designed to serve the special educational needs of a sizeable number of Spanish dominant students attending the Community College of Philadelphia. A major goal of this program is to provide the city's Hispanic community with an opportunity to acquire English language proficiency through its intensive English as a second language component, and to increase access to post secondary education for Hispanic students in the Philadelphia public schools.

To meet the objectives of the current study, 54 female Iranian EFL learners were selected. In experimental group they listened to podcast files while in the control group they listened to a radio program. The practices were done through cognitive and metacognitive strategies. A self-regulation ability questionnaire was administered among the participants of both groups. Also, the data obtained from learners' self-reflection journals were added and interpreted qualitatively and supported the results of this study. Keeping a self-reflection journal provided a detailed account of learners' thoughts and perception regarding their listening to podcasts. It revealed learners' positive prospective toward podcasting application in the language learning process and it was clear that the participants in experimental group played a much more dynamic role as a learner. According to the findings of this study use of podcasts as an educational technology can significantly influence and foster self-regulation ability of the learners.

Although state legislatures, courts, and various educational agencies and community groups had increasingly supported bilingual education since passage of the Bilingual Education Act of 1968, support had varied and no national policy existed regarding distribution of funds. Many Texas school districts receiving the most federal funding for bilingual education were identified as being centers of Mexican American power, often equated with participation in the League of  United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and/or as areas where reapportionment litigation had occurred. Three counties with 1,200 or more persons of Spanish language or surname under 18 years of age had no bilingual education programs.

Drawing on the concept of language ideology, this article shows that the perceived social prestige associated with a language choice is closely intertwined with the discourse of quality education in Nepal. In this context, the students secure 'imageries of competence' by repeatedly drawing attention to more acceptable indicators of 'quality' such as high examination scores, English proficiency and continuation of higher studies.

Additionally, language learning has greatly contributed to standardizing lesson plans. They set the basis for learning design, one of the last advances in the pedagogical organization of education through the use of computers in learning managing systems. Most recently, language learning has also played an innovative role in the implementation of portfolios to education. These three perspectives address different issues for e-learning: the access to content through technology; the design of the learning initially with the help of tutors and then applying institutional frameworks for their own personal learning processes; and the edition of the resulting e-learning experience as evidence with the e-dossier, a part of the e-portfolio. Currently, the web is evolving towards its original function as the read/write web where the user, apart from accessing information, can create their own information and communicate more interactively, using technology-enhanced learning environments to integrate text and multimedia for real audiences both in the classroom and outside.

This article presents findings from a small-scale case study that aimed at exploring the nature of teachers' asynchronous exchanges in a discussion list. The data comprised the archived log of the messages in a Yahoo Group discussion list by five in-service English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers who volunteered to take part in a hybrid computer-assisted language learning (CALL) teacher education course in a state university in Iran. The discussion list was incorporated into the course to engage participants in professional dialogue on topics related to technology/CALL. During the initial data analysis, participants' asynchronous exchanges were grouped as suggestions, questions, unclassified, answers, and delivery, drawing upon Oriogun and Cave's (2008) SQUAD categorization, following the constant comparative method of analysis. Through a follow-up computer-mediated discourse analysis, cognitive, social, and teaching presence functional moves were identified in the data. Participants used the space not only for socializing and peer instruction but also for constructing knowledge. Despite an uneven pattern of contribution, asynchronous exchanges provided opportunities for knowledge construction at different levels of cognitive presence on topics ranging from technology tools and their affordances/constraints to computer-assisted language testing, materials development, and classroom management. The findings provide CALL teacher education researchers and course designers insights into the potential of asynchronous interaction for online and blended language teacher education.\",\n",
       " \"Numerous studies have indicated that the provision of appropriate computer-mediated support to second language (L2) learners results in different vocabulary learning outcomes. However, there is no study available that investigates the transition in their way of learning vocabulary under the influence of technology-based support. This article presents a comparative study that examines the differences between L2 learners' use of vocabulary strategies with or without such support. Twenty-four ESL students in a Toronto high school were involved. A language learning system was implemented to facilitate a technology-enhanced reading environment. Observations and tape-recorded field notes contribute to the data collection. The results showed that (a) a variety of strategies were employed across cognitive, compensatory, metacognitive and social categories when students learned vocabulary through sustained reading within the computer-mediated environment and that (b) significant variations in the techniques and functionalities of strategies were found between the two reading conditions. Situated within the vocabulary learning strategy framework, the article argues that the technology-enhanced scaffoldings can effectively assist students to advance their learning strategies, potentially optimizing their reading-based vocabulary acquisition.

       " \"Two proposals to reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) are in the House of Representatives: the &quot;Workforce Investment and Improvement Act of 2012&quot; (&quot;H.R. 4297&quot;) and the &quot;Workforce Investment Act of 2012&quot; (&quot;H.R. 4227&quot;). Both proposals reflect a priority of greater alignment among adult education (Title II), workforce development (Title I), and postsecondary education, and both increase the focus on preparing adult students not just to earn a secondary school diploma but for college and careers. Despite these similarities, the bills differ across several dimensions, such as the degree to which they hold states and local providers accountable for improving student access and success in postsecondary education and the commitment to expanding the capacity and resources of the adult education system nationally. This analysis highlights key provisions in each bill that strengthen or weaken the overall goal of refocusing Title II on career and postsecondary success. The analysis is organized by CLASP's four core priorities in adult education: (1) To align services and improve outcomes across workforce development, postsecondary education, and adult education/English as a Second Language; (2) To incent and encourage innovation in promising practices, such as career pathways, contextualization, dual or concurrent enrollment, and integrated basic education and occupational skills training; (3) To develop a national research center for adult education to advance promising practices and expand and improve the body of evidence-based research; and (4) To fund Title II to meet the growing demand for adult education and English language services. On the whole, &quot;H.R. 4297&quot; offers improvements to the adult education system and supports alignment between programs, although it does little to ensure that this alignment will happen. Furthermore, it creates an option for states to override adult education requirements and consolidate these funds with a newly created Workforce Investment Fund, leaving no assurances that low-skilled adult learners will be served. &quot;H.R. 4227&quot; modernizes and enhances the adult education system to better meet the longer-term, postsecondary, and employment needs of students. It also builds capacity for additional research on innovative and promising practices that have the potential to accelerate student progress toward these goals. Lastly, it requires that education and training programs work together in each state to develop a joint state plan, yet it maintains individualized programs to ensure that those who need targeted attention or more specialized instruction can receive it.

From the start, the reform plan came under fire locally on grounds related either to ideological concerns or to implementational practicalities. Results of students in all grades on national examinations, which the Supreme Educational Council (SEC) oversaw, showed that a very small percentage of students (8-20%) had mastered the set learning outcomes in any of the main four subjects (Mathematics, Sciences, English, and Arabic). These results showed clearly that the reform initiative had failed to deliver on promises of improved student performance (Kirkpatrick and Barnawi, in: Kirkpatrick (ed) English language education in the Middle East and North Africa, Springer, Switzerland, 2017). In 2012, these perceived failures led the SEC to issue a decree reinstating Arabic as the language of instruction in grades K-12 in schools as well as at Qatar University in all areas of social sciences.

However, these debates are rarely cognizant of Gramsci's own university training in linguistics, the centrality of language to his writings on education and hegemony, or his specific engagement with language politics in his own day. By paying much greater attention to Gramsci's writings on language and education, this article attempts to lay the groundwork for an adequate approach to the current politics of global English. While Gramsci may have left formal education and his studies in linguistics at Turin University as a young man to become a full time journalist and political activist, he certainly did not &quot;jettison&quot; his study of language as is commonly implied. It has been widely accepted that Gramsci had an expansive conception of education which would curtail any suggestion that &quot;education&quot; must be limited to formal schooling or university. Likewise, this article demonstrates the importance of Gramsci's lifelong analysis of language, its role in education and the development of hegemony. It argues that Gramsci's writings on language policy in Italy, specifically &quot;la questione della lingua&quot; [the language question] and his concern with linguistics, are an integral part of his approach to education and hegemony.\",\n",

These participants responded to a questionnaire survey about the effects of the Covid-19 epidemic on language education and how they dealt with these. We statistically analysed the responses through four domains: the use of ICT in students' lives; the use of ICT in education generally; the use of ICT to support learning and teaching in EFL; and teachers' perceived skills for using ICT in education. Results indicated that English language teachers in Palestinian public schools believed that ICT has clear potential to support the learning of English, but that there remain barriers to its implementation. Teachers feel equipped to use ICT but would like to see a greater emphasis on training in order to maximise their teaching.\",\n",

However, the success of ICT in any learning institution including Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) depends on the attitudes of undergraduates towards using ICT in their daily learning. Therefore, this paper aimed to investigate the critical factors that impact undergraduates use of ICT in learning at Kuwait universities. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was applied to reach the aim of the study. A sample of 717 undergraduates was selected from a public and a private university in Kuwait. The critical factors examined in this study are the type of university, language of learning and ICT support. Mixed methods such as quantitative and qualitative methods were conducted for the data collection. The quantitative results suggested that the Usefulness of ICT and Ease of use of ICT factors are the key dimensions of undergraduates' attitudes towards ICT. Another result showed that the examined factors have had a direct impact on undergraduates' attitudes. Moreover, the qualitative results suggested the factor of peer learning had a strong impact on undergraduates' attitudes towards the use of ICT.\",\n",

The pandemic has affected all areas of education and foreign language teaching has not been the exception. The study presents key aspects of teacher experience and training in relation to their use of ICT, which has become ubiquitous for teaching and learning during the last two years. For this study, a mixed methodology approach was used with a semistructured questionnaire that was administered through social networks as well as WhatsApp and emails. A total of 184 responses were recorded from English teachers from all educational levels, public and private schools as well as language institutions. The results showcase that the main aspects affecting the development of classes are teachers' experience using ICT tools, training received, and technology appropriation. Moreover, the availability of a variety of tools for synchronous and asynchronous instruction, communication, and evaluation allowed teachers to rapidly transition into Emergency Remote Teaching.

       " \"Descriptive mixed-methods were employed to investigate the experiences and perceptions of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) Thai students in higher education in integrating Augmented Reality technology (AR) in their reading classroom. Participants were queried on their habitual use of computers and the Internet, their perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages of AR, their experiences in using AR, and their reflective reports of self-efficacy in using AR in creating English vocabulary flashcards as supplemental learning resources. A questionnaire on their use of computers and the Internet was employed with 48 EFL, English-major undergraduates. Subsequently, the participants underwent the Classroom Activity Treatment which comprised (1) the Teacher Showcase, (2) the AR Computer Tutorial, and (3) the Student Showcase, respectively. Classroom observation notes were taken during the three phases. Besides, at the end of each of these three phases, a questionnaire on the acceptance and self-efficacy of AR was administered. Subsequently, 24 students participated in semi-structured interviews to elicit further insights into their perceptions of the effectiveness of AR in EFL instruction and learning. The Technology Acceptance Model 3 (Vankatesh &amp; Bala, 2008) was employed for theoretical perspective on the data. Findings revealed most participants had no prior knowledge or understanding about AR before the study. Participants reported AR as advantageous for stimulating student engagement and motivation, and for enhancing memory and memorization. AR was reported to promote learning and practicing digital literacy skills. Participants reported relatively high levels of self-efficacy in using AR, which were primarily driven by their self-satisfaction, creativity and enthusiasm, peer and teacher assistance, as well as technological training and infrastructure. Participants also reported that they would continue using AR in the future when necessary resources, time, and access were secured, for the purposes of professional productivity and development. Analysis suggested that English education curricula be improved and re-designed to integrate the implementation of AR technology to tailor the learning experiences to the students' needs and learning styles. Professional development and training should also be provided for teachers and students to educate them in using AR in language education teaching and learning.

       " \"This article examines the relationship between international education and English as an additional language (EAL) education in British Columbia's public education system. Drawing on a wide range of data generated as part of a longitudinal study of high school aged fee-paying international students (FISs) in an urban school district in British Columbia, I make the case that FIS recruitment and presence is having a socializing impact on EAL education in British Columbia's public schools. In contrast to the way FISs are accounted for in official government statistics, I show how, across multiple actors and dimensions of the public system, FISs are routinely treated and represented as English language learners(ELLs). I argue that these routinized constructions are evidence of the multilayered socialization of EAL education by internationalization efforts in British Columbia's K-12 sector, and discuss some of the ways this FIS socialization is consequential for EAL learning and teaching in public high schools. I situate my discussion of the FIS-EAL relationship within the larger context of applied linguistics and education-related research on internationalization and educational migration in K-12 settings, and raise questions about how FIS socialization is relevant to discussions of public education.\",\n",

One hundred forty-eight argumentative essays were analyzed. The essays underwent interrating by three independent raters using a 20-point rubric and were grouped according to rating. Repetition was the most frequently used lexical cohesive device among the three groups of essays. Antonyms, meronyms, and hyponyms followed respectively. Super ordinates and collocation occurred less frequently in the essays. There was a low correlation between the frequency of lexical devices and writing quality. Therefore, there was no significant relationship between lexical cohesive devices and writing quality. Qualitative findings reveal that synonyms in the highly-rated essays were utilized by the students to denote the positive effects and to define technology. Antonyms were used for comparison and contrast and to denote the positive effects of technology in the low-rated essays. Unlike in the highly-rated essays where synonyms were used to give positive effects of technology, antonyms were used to denote positive effects of technology in the low-rated essays to achieve such communicative purpose. Other lexical devices assisted the students in fulfilling their writing requirement. Hyponyms were employed to explain how a particular concept contributes to or is a part of a bigger concept. Meronyms were used to give examples of a concept and to define a term. Superordinates were utilized to give a specific kind or brand of a more general idea.\",\n",

However, a review of TPACK research specific to language teachers' knowledge about language teaching with technology has been lacking. To fill this research gap, the present review study intends to understand the landscape of TPACK research on language teachers published from 2011 to 2019. The analysis results reveal that 51 studies were identified with a publication peak in 2015, mostly conducted in Asia and the Middle East. The 51 articles were categorized into four areas: (a) exploring TPACK, (b) assessing TPACK, (c) developing TPACK, and (d) applying TPACK. More specifically, research on exploring TPACK suggests that while teachers had varying levels of confidence in their TPACK competence, their TPACK indicated the dominant use of technology in traditional teacher-centered teaching. Research on assessing TPACK shows that survey items were contextualized to lessen the difficulty of distinguishing between the seven sub-domains of TPACK. However, the difficulty remained perhaps due to a possibility that the seven sub-domains may not appear workable in practice. This issue needs further research. Research on developing TPACK reveals that effective interventions involved language teachers' understanding of the TPACK framework, modeling from teacher educators or experienced teachers, and language teachers' engagement in designing lessons collaboratively. Finally, research on applying TPACK indicates that TPACK-informed language learning courses and platforms were perceived to be helpful and effective. These findings may provide researchers with some possible directions.\",\n",

However, few studies have touched on how image-to-text recognition technology can be used for writing. The present research was conducted to fill this gap by exploring the optimization of a deep-learning-based image captioning algorithm to facilitate English writing, so as to enable learners to break the time and space limitations and learn English writing (including sentence patterns, spelling, vocabulary, and grammar) anytime and anywhere by taking pictures. Therefore, this paper focused on image captioning based on CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), using DenseNet201 or Vision Transformer trained on the ImageNet-1K image classification dataset as the image encoder and LSTM as the decoder. First, pre-training was performed on the Flickr8k dataset. After selecting the best-trained model as the pre-trained weight model for the COCO dataset, fine-tuning optimization was performed on the COCO dataset, and the attention mechanism was used to design the ablation experiment. The BLEU-4, CIDEr, METEOR, and ROUGE evaluation indexes of the optimized model on the test set were 0.3437,1.121,0.2750, and 0.5117, respectively. The study results showed that the convergence of the model was accelerated and had better performance. The model was used to automatically caption 12 images that had never been used during the training process. The descriptions generated by the optimized image captioning algorithm have lexical and syntactic accuracy, and matched what the images expressed, showing that this improved algorithm could be used as a learning tool to help English learners improve lexical and syntactic acquisition to promote writing through the generated descriptions of the pictures taken anytime and anywhere in real-life situations.',\n",

       " 'The 2002 Language Policy for Higher Education (LPHE) identifies the currently dominant language of instruction--English--as being a possible barrier to many African students in accessing and successfully completing studies at higher education level. The LPHE thus requires that black African languages be developed at Higher Education Institutions for use as languages of teaching and learning, alongside English and Afrikaans. It is hoped that such a move would, among other things, enable South Africans to take pride in being bi/multilingual. Hence, this paper examines the relationship between language identity and bi/multilingual education. In conducting the study, the participants who are mostly isiZulu speaking in an educational institution in which their primary language (L1) dominates on campus and in the surrounding community were exposed to Zulu--English instructional material in their academic literacy and communication skills course. While the findings indicate a strong African pride among the majority of respondents about the use of their languages in education, concerns, however, are raised about the negative impact this might have on their development of proficiency in English and the practicality of bi/multilingual instruction on campuses with a diverse racial student population. This view indicates a struggle experienced by many Africans between maintaining their languages in education and developing English that is in high demand in education, commerce and as a common language of communication across ethnic and racial lines in South Africa and elsewhere.',\n",
       " 'In South Africa, higher education policy documents propose technology and resource-based teaching and learning to prepare youth for the knowledge and information society, and for a socially transformed society. However, the extent to which these policies are being implemented is still uncertain. This article reports on a technology-based English course that incorporates face-to-face and online modes of delivery at a South African university. The aim of the paper is to examine how the only blind participant among a group of sighted participants positions herself and engages with the technological practices of the university, as well as the course, given the recommendations of the policies. Included is a discussion of how she constructs her identity and negotiates meaning in the course. The construction of identity is explored from a post-modern view that old identities, which stabilised the social world, are in decline, giving rise to new identities and fragmenting the modern individual as a unified subject. I explore views of identity as how people understand their relationship in the world, how that relationship is constructed across time and space, and how people understand their possibilities for the future. I also draw on discussions of positioning and self. Finally, I suggest implications that such a study might have for pedagogy, practice and policy in higher education institutions in South Africa.

       " 'For many years, technology has been applied to improve the quality of language learning and teaching. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the integration of technology in different language learning contexts. The sudden shift to online teaching faced educators with an array of challenges they had not experienced before. In particular, the teachers encountered many barriers with the online assessment of the students. To shed more light on what passed, following a qualitative mode of inquiry, the present study set out to find out how a group of 20 Iranian English language teachers at Persian Gulf University faced with the online assessment challenges posed by COVID-19. For this aim, the researchers conducted in-depth semi-structured retrospective interviews with the teachers at different times throughout the course. In addition, the teachers were asked to provide a narrative account of how they responded to the crisis. The analysis of the findings showed that after the shift to online assessment, the teachers initially faced with serious pedagogical, technical, administrative, and affective barriers, but as the course proceeded, they could adjust their practice with the new situation. However, the teachers recounted problems that still remained and negatively affected their practice. Overall, the study discusses that to improve the online assessment in the post-COVID-19 era several technological, pedagogical, and administrative measures should be taken into account. These would further improve the integration of the technology in the pedagogical context in the long run.',\n",
       " \"There is obvious pressure for higher education institutions to undergo transformation now in China. Reflecting this, the computer and information technology give rise to the development of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) embedded flipped classroom. Flipped classroom approaches replace the traditional transmissive teaching with engaging in-class and pre-/post-class work. This paper provides an overview of relevant literature about the emergence of the flipped classroom and its links to pedagogy and educational outcomes, followed by an analysis of the survey results of a one year experiment using a flipped classroom approach which involved 800 students at Shenzhen University. The questionnaire completed by 230 students at the end of the second semester investigated students' attitudes as well as their perceived benefits and effects of this new approach. The results reveal that the majority of students preferred the flipped method, and over 50% of them felt they were making good progress in many aspects of their English language learning. The paper argues that a MOOC embedded flipped approach promotes student active, autonomous, and collaborative learning skills, and it contributes to a better understanding of technology-enhanced, student-centred learning environments.

       " 'Adopting online learning as a mandated means of instruction amid the pandemic guaranteed students the opportunity to integrate digital technologies for English language learning. This experience was pivotal in investigating the continuous use of these platforms to facilitate online language learning post-pandemic. However, few studies have focused on this context, especially considering the psychological aspects of language learning through these gained learning experiences. Therefore, this study explores this narrative based on the technology acceptance model and external factors such as confidence in English (CONF), online learning anxiety (ANX), and familiarity with education technology (EdTech). Using the partial least square approach, data from the 530 Malaysian undergraduates analysed revealed that perceived ease of use (PEOU) precedes perceived usefulness (PU) as the most crucial factor influencing attitude and intention to use online learning. Likewise, CONF and ANX had stronger associations with PEOU than PU, but EdTech was found to be inconsequential towards attitude and PU. The results of this study underline the importance of PEOU that heralds PU in determining the continuous use of online tools for English language learning in higher educational institutions.',\n",

This study examines how six English speakers of other languages (ESOL) teachers used podcasting and blogging to help young English learners, themselves 21st century digital citizens. The ESOL teachers used technology to develop innovative teaching methods and enhance their professional identities. Four themes emerged from the examination of ESOL teachers' uses of new technologies to increase peer engagement through deep classroom interaction: ESOL teachers' varying levels of use of instructional innovations, dialogic uses of podcasting and blogging to encourage educational engagement, the impact of innovative technology on teachers' professional identities, teaching digital-native English learners, benefits of technology for assignments, and challenges for ESOL teachers' active learning.\",\n",

However, few international virtual learning projects have been implemented and researched. This article examines a trial which aimed to combine viable technology with future pedagogic solutions for primary students from Korea and Finland and create an international collaboration model in virtual learning for environmental education. The results show various challenges of the operational model and suggest effective implementation strategies. The challenges were organisational, language, technical and collaboration barriers. The operational model illustrates possibilities of implementing cyber space pedagogy, visualization of knowledge using technology, cyber spaces for collaboration, and the motivational impetus provided by the model.

It explores the effects of EFL teachers' personal and technology-related variables in ICT use in English high school classes. The study opts for a descriptive and an analytical method to account for this claim. Therefore, a mixed-methods approach is used. A survey questionnaire and interviews are conducted to obtain a corpus of data that is both representative and reliable. The sample of the study consists of 30 teachers of English in six high schools in the city of Meknes.

Interior variables refer to the teacher's attitude and dilemma towards using ICT while exterior ones are strongly associated with the lack of ICT facilities and ICT-related equipment in the Moroccan high schools.\",\n",
       " 'Recent trends in education have pushed for multimedia to be made a part of every effective language program. As a result, language programs around the world are incorporating computer labs into their curricula. However, as many instructors and administrators are unfamiliar with this newer technology, integrating computer assisted language learning (CALL) into their overall goals and objectives often proves problematic. This leads to under-utilization of the technology which in turn creates a general sense of dissatisfaction. The first part of this paper presents the results of a year-long study of a multimedia lab at a full-time, intensive language institute. The instruments for this study included: surveys of both students and instructors; interviews with the program coordinator, students, and instructors; and valuations of the lab facilities in terms of hardware and software; and finally, a year-long qualitative assessment of the multimedia lab. The initial data collected from this study demonstrated that although student knowledge of computers was limited, they felt that CALL was an effective learning tool. Instructors also understood the potential of CALL, yet were unsure of how to integrate it into their teaching methods. Finally, administrators as well were enthusiastic about implementing CALL into their programs, yet were concerned with logistical and budgetary issues. It is the goal of this presentation to provide instructors and administrators with some practical suggestions for effectively managing a multimedia lab.   To this end, the latter part of the paper is divided into three sections: (1) methods for assessing student and faculty needs, and how goals and objectives for a multimedia lab can be established to meet these needs, (2) the development of materials for use in the lab that attempt to accommodate instructor needs with available technology, and (3) procedures to overcome the logistical problems that confront all such labs such as student and faculty training, scheduling and staffing issues, hardware/software management, and assessment and acquisition of new software.

       " \"Technology development allows new ways of communication, learning and collaboration. This is reflected in the professional scenarios of language teaching. Modern curricula value participants' interest and meaningful (inter)action as a basis for learning. Sensitivity is important in anticipating participants' changing needs in modern learning environments, characterised by linguistic and technological hybridity, as well as novel pedagogical approaches. Language students, more familiar with teaching in the traditional classroom, need to appropriate new practices to orchestrate learning in settings requiring multiple activities simultaneously. This study explores how language students learn to manage complex pedagogical situations during a university course in which they create an online project for school children. During online chat sessions administered for the school pupils, the university lecturer's office was an important site for negotiating and acting on pedagogical issues as well as practical matters arising from the work at hand. Nexus analysis was used as a research approach. Primary research materials include video recordings from the university lecturer's office, chatlogs and reflection papers from students. The study is relevant for reconceptualising the changing roles of (language) teachers and provides new perspectives for language teacher education in a technology-rich world.\",\n",

Anti-bilingual education initiatives have passed easily in California, Arizona, and Massachusetts, while one was closely defeated in Colorado, and federal education policy has re-invigorated the focus on English education for English language learners, while concomitantly obfuscating the possibility of native language maintenance and developmental bilingual education. This is the educational landscape within which bilingual education researchers, educators, and students must face the formidable challenge of preserving educational choice and bilingual education. Thus, substantive research is needed on how bilingual educators navigate this challenging ideological and policy landscape. Based on an ethnographic study of bilingual education language policy, this article takes up this challenge by focusing on how beliefs about &quot;Applied Linguistics&quot; research influence the interpretation and appropriation of federal language policy in one US school district.

Despite widespread literature on STEAM pedagogy, evidence on the benefit of integrating STEAM with technology-enhanced language learning at elementary levels is insufficient. This study thus inspects the impact of incorporating digital storytelling (DST) into STEAM teaching on young language learners' development of self-regulation and English literacy. Thirty-three schoolchildren participated in the study as the experimental and control groups. Their English literacy and self-regulation were examined before and after the study. Both groups received STEAM instructional content in English for one semester. The DST group worked with the online platform StoryJumper to make digital books for their projects; meanwhile, the control group prepared their projects by reports and presentations. At the end of the experiment, the DST group's academic self-regulation improved significantly which was the result of their enhanced introjected and external regulation. Also, the DST group outperformed the control group in English literacy. Due to the key role of STEAM education in making students interested in STEAM disciplines at elementary levels, planning and implementing best practices of STEAM pedagogy for schoolchildren is recommended.\",\n",

Common criticisms of special education and changing assumptions underlying it are outlined. Models that have been proposed to explain minority failure in school as something other than inherent disability are analyzed; these models focus on social and cultural factors influencing education. Directions for changing the process of special education to meet the needs of culturally and linguistically diverse students are offered in the areas of assessment and intervention. Three primary goals for the restructuring of bilingual special education are identified: (1) inclusion (conforming the classroom to the needs of all students); (2) increased academic performance; and (3) a shift  from the remedial approach to a diagnostic teaching paradigm, with teachers actively involved in assessment and curricular adaptation. Four successful program models are described briefly. It is argued that new assumptions about special education must be adopted for more useful and equitable bilingual education, and five new assumptions are presented.

As a result, the present study aimed at not only examining but also comparing the effectiveness of web-mediated, blended, and purely online learning instructions on EFL learners' writing achievement in the Iranian context. Therefore, 49 homogenous participants were randomly assigned into the web-mediated leaning (WML) group that attended the workshop physically at predetermined times, the enriched virtual blended learning (EVBL) group that not only was provided with online sessions but also received compulsory in-person instructional sessions, and the purely online leaning (POL) group that merely received an online instruction. All learners delivered four argumentative essay writing pre-tests, performed the WebQuest tasks, engaged in pair/group works, completed all the sub-tasks, and finally wrote four essays as post-tests. The results of paired-samples t-tests revealed that EFL learners' achievement in writing skill as a whole and writing sub-skills improved significantly from pre-tests to post-tests in all the WML, EVBL, and POL groups. The mentioned finding was vindicated considering the peculiar characteristic of EFL learners and the distinctive nature of TEIs. In addition, the results of one-way between-groups ANOVA indicated that WML and EVBL groups outperformed the POL group in the overall writing achievement, which was explained in the light of technology-related dimension, the interaction dimension, and the conventional perspective of education dimension.

Despite the many obstacles, students and instructors in no-tech environments can still use their PC's and internet connection from home or may set up a small network using few PC's and a phone line. Instructors and students can make use of the many tools and resources available on the net such as e-mail, newsgroups, discussion forums, mailing lists, language websites, online dictionaries, online encyclopedias, authoring tools, online quizzes and online courses to supplement classroom instruction. Many research findings have shown that use of technology in EFL instruction has resulted in significant gains in achievement and positive attitudes towards learning, because use of CALL provides additional practice, a self-paced and non-threatening learning environment, integrates sound, pictures, motion, color, and different skills. The students enjoy using the internet, find it useful and fun, and consider it a new way of leaning and doing homework. It heightens their motivation and raises their self-esteem. It creates a warm climate between the students and instructor and among the students themselves. They can use it any time and as many times as they need. Despite the glamour of technology, its use does not guarantee students' success in learning nor higher levels of achievement than traditional classroom techniques. The effective use of technology depends on how it is used, what is being taught, and for how long. Its use is always associated with problems such as: bad connection, slow browsing, some students do not post any responses if not prompted by the instructor and if the instructor does not post new topics, post a sample response, and give marks. Some students do not take online instruction seriously. Using the internet as a learning tool may not be part of some students' culture. Some are so used to traditional instruction that depended on the book. The instructor may not have sufficient time in the classroom to brainstorm topics, provide training and give instructions. The content and difficulty level of the material available on the net may be inappropriate for the students' proficiency level and course objectives. The online course design may be too basic or too complicated for the students. Teaching with technology does not cancel the teacher's role. It poses new challenges and requires enthusiasm, some training and perseverance. In CALL, the teacher serves as a facilitator. He/she has to provide the students with technical support, train them, respond to individual students' needs, comments, and requests, look for relevant websites, post questions, discussion topics and online activities, write model responses, send public and private messages, and design exercises and quizzes every week.

The researchers investigated the pros and cons of having local mentor support for an online course titled Using Technology in the English Language Classroom provided by the AE E-Teacher Program. The course was offered to preservice teachers from 24 different universities across Turkey. The study collected data through a pre- and post-online survey and individual semistructured interviews. The results revealed that while local mentoring as a supplement to the main course content contributed to teacher candidates' emotional and professional attachment to their profession by helping them relate theory to contextualized educational settings, it can still be improved by the integration of more interactive tasks that would help the attendees refer to specific practical implementation of the educational technology tools introduced in the program.\",\n",
       " \"Introduction: In line with technological developments, many educational institutions offer students and teachers technical opportunities to benefit both inside and outside the schools. From the perspective of utilizing technology for a more effective language learning and teaching process, the present study aims to reveal techno-cultural awareness levels and self-reported competencies of secondary school English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers working in Turkey. Methods: A total of 36 secondary school teachers participated in the study, and data were collected through a questionnaire and focus group interview. The focus group interview was conducted after the quantitative data analysis so that the quantitative data results guided the focus group interviews. Results: The study's findings show that participants have positive attitudes towards using technology in EFL classes However, most participants still feel they are not competent enough to utilize it for instructional purposes. In this context, all participants agree that the education they received during pre-service and in-service training offered by the Ministry of National Education (MoNE) is insufficient. Discussion: The results obtained from data analysis are in parallel with some other studies. According to the findings, pre-service teacher training programmes need to be developed in line with the needs and expectations of teachers and learners regarding the use of technology in language teaching. Furthermore, it is suggested that teachers should be supported with much more comprehensive in-service training programmes to keep them up-to-date. In this regard, professional development programmes based explicitly on improving teachers' technological awareness would motivate them to teach and significantly impact their self-reported capabilities. Limitations: This study was limited to 36 participants working in secondary schools in the same province. Therefore, the results cannot be generalized to all language teachers. Furthermore, the data collection process was carried out using questionnaires and focus group interviews. Conclusions: What makes this study significant is that teachers are central to the research. From this point forth, the current study results reveal the analysis of the data obtained from a small province of Turkey. However, the study shows significant and representative results because the teachers included in the study are individuals with the same educational levels. They have graduated from different universities in Turkey, and their working environments somewhat reflect Turkey's working environments. Considering the differences between teachers' positive attitudes towards technology utilization in EFL classes and their capabilities, it is argued that in-service and pre-service training programmes should be reviewed to overcome these deficiencies and keep up with the new developments.\",\n",

This study contributes to the knowledge on the outcomes of disadvantaged individuals who complete higher education by looking at the labour market outcomes of university graduates from equity groups. The number of Indigenous graduates and graduates with disabilities was found to be very low, suggesting that more needs to be done to improve higher education completion for these two groups. The labour market outcomes for other equity groups are mixed, with those from low socio-economic status backgrounds and regional and remote Australia performing well in the labour market, while graduates from non-English-speaking backgrounds and female graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields experience substantial disadvantage in the labour market. The findings suggest that selection processes prior to the graduates' entry into the labour market are important.\",\n",

To test the hypothesized model through a path analysis, 169 survey responses were collected from undergraduate students who were foreign language learners of English in a Chinese research university. The results indicated that although intrinsic motivation did not have a direct influence on students' behavioral intention in MALL, it had a positive influence on students' behavioral intention through the two intervening variables, perceived usefulness and task technology fit. Perceived ease of use, however, was not associated with students' behavioral intention directly, nor was it predicted by intrinsic motivation.

Utilising the Qualitative Document Analysis (QDA) method, official public documents were collected through web and catalogue searches. Dominant themes were identified through manual and electronic coding using MaxQDA software. These emergent themes were examined through the lens of the edutocracy and elite theories to provide more in-depth analysis of this research problem. The document analysis constructed a narrative of how colonial ideology embedded within the inherited West Indian educational system runs counter to the progressive and more humanist visions and missions envisaged for present-day Caribbean education, culminating in deleterious conflicts between educational theory and practice. This work therefore concludes that there has been little substantive Caribbean education reform owing to the significant gaps between early twenty-first century, and even earlier drafted education visions, and current education practice.',\n",

       " 'Bilingual education has had great impact on education in the United States. Bilingual education programs have existed since 1845. Between 1854-1877, eight states enacted laws stipulating that local school boards had the power to require English-German bilingual programs. Many bilingual education programs were created, thrived, and eventually died; some continued according to the political climate. The government directly addressed the issue in 1968 by passing the Bilingual Education Act, Title VII, which made provisions for the special needs of children with limited English-speaking abilities, who came from low socioeconomic environments where the dominant language was not English. As of 1978, 22 states have enacted mandates requiring bilingual education in their schools. Among  the arguments of opponents of bilingual education are that bilingual education is an effort to teach young children in their native tongue; that English monolingualism and acculturation to mainstream United States society are sure indicators of being worthy, productive citizens; and that children entering public schools speaking a language other than English need constant exposure to English, with any other language delimiting progress.

       " 'Mexico is experiencing major reform in adult education. At the same time, Mexico has been the largest producer of immigrants into the United States in the last 50 years. At the beginning of the century, non-English-speaking immigrants were only required to learn enough English to perform their jobs. As the Mexican-American community grew, it demanded equal educational opportunities for its children. Today school-age children within the immigrant communities have good opportunities to attend bilingual education programs, but their parents do not have the same opportunities. Adults now arrive with more education than previously, and have less difficulty adjusting to the new environment. Due to the peculiar pattern of Mexican migration, Mexico and the United States should work  together in adult, child, and bilingual education as a whole and in relation to the needs of immigrants and their families.

In our time, in which the developments have gained an enormous pace, particularly in technology, this requirement has become vital for teachers whose contributions to shape societies are immense. With the recent advances in technology, it has become of great importance for teachers to learn the emerging new media culture and use them effectively in their lessons. On the other hand, as a result of these rapid developments, the acquisition of critical thinking, which dates back to ancient times as a concept, by teachers as a skill has become more important than ever before. At this point, there are evaluations made regarding the importance of these two skills primarily in teacher training programs. In line with these evaluations, this study examined the relationship between the critical thinking dispositions (CTD) and their new media literacy levels (NML) of pre-service English teachers studying at the education faculties of two foundation universities. Results showed that the candidates participating in the research have high level critical thinking and new media literacy skills, and there is a moderate positive relationship between these two skills.',\n",

Users of these tools have the capability to graph, model, compute, visualize, simulate, and manipulate, which \"amplify\" mathematical properties and concepts. These cognitive technology tools have the potential to broaden the representational tools that are available to teachers and students. To leverage cognitive tech tools for mathematics teaching and learning, teachers must consider the needs of diverse learners and be equipped to support their learning difficulties by taking advantage of this technology. Most important, teachers must have \"tech-knowledgy\": the knowledge necessary to use cognitive tech tools effectively to construct mathematical knowledge, evaluate the mathematical opportunities presented, and design learning tasks with these tools that amplify the mathematics. Ways to leverage technology by integrating cognitive tech tools to promote critical thinking and problem will be described in this article, as well as examples of how they have been used.

       " 'This conceptual paper aims to review some commonalities between two paradigms: Global Englishes and translanguaging. It does so by considering the postcolonial varieties of English, the challenge of native speakerism ideology and the inclusion of multiple discursive practices in classroom discourse. This paper argues that both paradigms should be recognised and incorporated into current English language education. It further asserts the need to regard the two paradigms as complementary but possibly conflated in future English language education. If the notion of Global Englishes aims to incorporate some issues in English language education, including linguistic imperialism, language policy and planning, translanguaging brings that aspiration into classroom discourse. Both policy makers and language practitioners should recognise the commonalities of Global Englishes and translanguaging to be conflated in current English language education. This paper discusses some proposals for how these two paradigms can be incorporated into English language education from the perspectives of (1) critical pedagogy in applied linguistics and (2) decolonising pedagogy for the inclusion of minority/indigenous languages in language education. This paper concludes that English language education, as well as language education in general, has the multilingual and translinguistic opportunity to promote diversity and inclusion of language use. The field of teaching English as a second/foreign/additional language should address the need for diversity and inclusion in language education from the perspective of Global Englishes and translanguaging not as lip service but by implementing these proposals into practice.',\n",

The results revealed that among different TBOCLLAs, receptive activities were relatively more frequent among learners than productive ones. Results also indicated that there was a strong positive correlation between technology-based out-of-class language learning activities and Iranian EFL learners' motivation levels. Moreover, it was found that there was a strong correlation between TBOCLLAs and the EFL learners' autonomy. In the same vein, the findings revealed a strong and statistically significant correlation between TBOCLLAs and the learners' self-efficacy. Finally, the research findings suggested that learners' motivation, autonomy, and self-efficacy were all significantly contributing to the participants' use of technology-based out-of-class language learning activities. Among the above mentioned individual factors, motivation had the highest predictive value, and among self-efficacy and autonomy, the latter could better predict the use of TBOCLLAs by the learners.\",\n",
       " 'Two facts have become clear since passage of the Workforce Investment Act in 1998. First, when low-skilled individuals increase their basic skills, these higher skills pay off in the labor market in the form of higher employment and earnings. Second, these earnings increases are typically modest and fall short of what people need to become self-sufficient, even for adult education participants that earn a GED. These facts have led a number of states and localities to focus on increasing transitions from adult education to postsecondary education and training. The early results are quite promising: (1) The Integrated Basic Education and Skills Training initiative (I-BEST) in Washington State pairs adult education/ESL instructors with vocational instructors to integrate contextualized remediation and English language services with occupational training; and (2) Kentucky has encouraged and supported local efforts to dual enroll students in adult education and college remediation, enabling them to work toward their GED and complete college coursework at the same time. Adult education students benefit greatly from programs such as those in Washington and Kentucky because they can earn marketable postsecondary credentials more quickly and avoid using up their limited student aid and personal resources on tuition for college remediation, accessing free adult education remediation for their coursework below college level. Many more states and localities could follow their example, but some are hesitant to do so without clearer guidance in this area from Congress. Currently Title II does not reflect this new consensus on the importance of postsecondary transitions for adult education students, and in fact there is much confusion in the field as to whether services that promote transitions are encouraged or even allowed under WIA. The recommendations offered in this paper are intended to update Title II to support state and local innovations in this critical area, which in turn will increase persistence in adult education, increase transitions to postsecondary programs, and help low-income adults attain marketable postsecondary credentials.

       " \"This mixed-method pre-test/post-test experimental study aims to investigate the effects of Augmented Reality (AR) supported English as a foreign language course on 42 high school students' attitudes towards the English language course, on learners' beliefs of self-efficacy in English and on their motivation towards the instructional materials used in the class. Following a 10-week teaching period, both the quantitative and the qualitative results showed that the AR-enhanced foreign language education significantly improved students' attitudes towards the English language course and increased their beliefs of self-efficacy in the English language. The results also revealed that the implementation of AR technology had a significant positive impact on the motivation levels of learners towards the instructional materials in the classroom. The AR technology in the class served as an interactive and entertaining tool which transformed a monotonous learning atmosphere into an engaging and effective one. Finally, the findings confirmed that AR-driven listening and speaking activities could lead students to gain a good understanding in English language topics and that teachers could make use of AR not only in classrooms but also for extra-curricular activities.\",\n",

       " \"Despite the increasing ownership of mobile devices among Chinese postgraduate EFL learners, relevant studies regarding mobile English learning resources (MELR) use by postgraduate learners are still lacking. This study tries to understand the uses and the motivation behind language learners' selection of MALL resources. In this research, 95 Chinese postgraduate students from four university levels took part in a questionnaire, and eight of them in an interview. The results show that &quot;passing exams&quot; was the top reason for using MELR and expanding one's English vocabulary was the aspect learners aimed to improve. The portability of mobile devices enabled learners to use MELR during short time intervals, which suggests that MALL applications should target this behaviour. However, as a type of supplementary material, few students used MELR for more than one hour per day, and they were not regularly and actively involved in using MELR. Few learners were able to select suitable MELR to meet their current English learning needs, and they relied on recommendations from social media and authoritative education experts. Due to the importance of vocabulary, mobile dictionaries and vocabulary learning applications were the learners' favourite type of MELR. As the participants suggested, enjoyment and interactivity were the two driving factors behind MELR selection and use. On the basis of Framework for the Rational Analysis of Mobile Education (FRAME, Koole, M. (2009). A model for framing mobile learning. In M.

To this end, the paper first presents the theoretical framework underpinning the study. This is followed by the introduction of the Set-up, Think, Explore, Create, Hone, Negotiate and Opine (STECHNO) model. The model was implemented in a 14-week program with 80 student teachers. A quasi-experimental research design was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the model. Data included survey responses, semi-structured interviews, written metaphors, reflection journals, observations and lesson plans. The results revealed that the S-TECHNO model can significantly improve student teachers' beliefs, knowledge and skills about the instructional use of technology. Implications for teacher education programs are highlighted and some future research possibilities are discussed.\",\n",

In Australia, the term multicultural education is generally understood to exclude Aborigines, a distinction in which Aboriginal educators concur as they assert the unique identity and claims of the Aboriginal populations. The discussion in this paper focuses on the educational response to the massive post-World War II immigration program and the responses to the wide range of ethnic groups contributing to Australian society in the 19th and 20th centuries. There have been three discernible responses to multicultural education in Australia: (1) a move from passive to active assimilation; (2) from immigrant education to  multicultural education; and (3) recognition of the economic imperatives of education. Multicultural educational research has considered curriculum reform, antiracism, English as a Second Language, and instruction in languages other than English.

       " 'Literature circles are a technique that brings small, heterogeneous groups of students together to discuss texts of their own choosing. Literature circle groups are typically comprised of four to six students, with each member assigned a role in advance that ensures balanced participation and equal opportunities for sharing ideas, expressing interpretations of texts, and responding to the contributions of others in the group. Research shows that the incorporation of literature circles promotes student self-determination, benefits students with special needs, exposes participants to multicultural texts, views, and perspectives, and develops reading enthusiasm. As such, the incorporation of literature circles has the potential of promoting literacy and language learning in inclusive classrooms with students from diverse cultures and learning needs. In this article, the authors propose a new take on traditional literature circles--which are called &quot;Literature Circles 2.0&quot;--by recognizing the importance of technology as a vital literacy skill in this new era of education.

The advent of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 2002, referred to as No Child Left Behind, has reframed the debate on teacher quality. Across the board, from scholars to government officials to private foundations, there is a call for reform of schools of education. It is these schools which are responsible for preparing teachers to educate students who will succeed in the globalized society of the 21st century; yet the voice of the classroom teacher is nearly absent. In this transcendental phenomenological study, I collected data from a sample of 25 educators who have been teaching in schools between 5 and 10 years. An online survey, face-to-face interviews, and one focus group was used to address the topic of how to improve teacher education to best meet the educational needs of a diverse student population. While nearly all participants expressed positive self-efficacy beliefs and an overall satisfaction with the quality of their respective teacher education programs, each reported deficiencies in preparation. Participants expressed concern in the areas of content knowledge, special education, teaching English language learners, using instructional technology, classroom management, and building relationships with families.

Irrespective of the profession, vocation and background the students have to hone their LSRW skills in English. Selection procedures like group discussion and video conferencing are hurdles to students who lack language proficiency in English. All prestigious, science based disciplines at the graduate and postgraduate level such as Computer Science, Engineering, and Medicine seem to be predominantly available only in English. The English proficiency of students educated in the vernacular medium is often deemed insufficient. This has led to a paradigm shift in the teaching/learning of English at the collegiate and higher education level. Apart from experimenting new teaching methods, teachers are now applying modern technology to support cultivation of language and linguistic skills to foster better achievement at higher education levels.This paper describes blogs as a simple, relatively low-tech, and effective tool to enhance language skills. Blogs are important for technologists, teachers, parents, and researchers who are interested in computer-mediated communication. Physical constraints such as the body, biological sex, race, or age can have a profound effect on self-definition and self-presentation (Collins &amp; Kuczaj, 1991); many of these attributes become flexible in online environments. The anonymity afforded within virtual worlds allows more flexibility in exploring their identity through their language, their role play, and the personae they assume (Calvert, 2002). The focus of this paper is on the &quot;boon&quot; rather than the &quot;bane&quot; of technology.

Denver School District No. 1. Lau v. Nichols was an action brought by non-English-speaking Chinese-origin students claiming to be denied an education because they could not comprehend the language in which they were being taught. After two appeals, the Supreme Court found in favor of the students under the 1964 Civil Rights Act, without prescribing a specific remedy. However, in Serna v. Portales the Circuit Court required bilingual education as a solution when a &quot;substantial group&quot; is involved. The decision in Aspira v. the N.Y.

The researcher gathered data from the local female teachers' point of view based on their motivation to receive training in becoming proficient in English and the use of mobile technology in teaching. A content analysis tool was used for analyzing, interpreting, coding, and categorizing textual data where themes will be identified based on a comprehensive classification system. The findings from the data analysis may aid schools in recruiting, training, and retaining local female teachers to provide quality education to the adolescent girls. The data from the single case study were able to provide information as to the use of mobile and web technologies in teaching and learning while local female teachers gain proficiency in the English language. The insight gained from this single-case study may help develop future technology budgets, infrastructure, and curriculum needs. The findings from research revealed that the rural Bangladeshi school teachers noted that there is limited use of videos in the classrooms for teaching due to, in some parts, the lack of training by school administrators on strategies to use videos in their teaching. Some barriers to the use of videos is due to the lack of Internet connection, the lack of knowledge on the proper use of videos in their teaching, and the lack of administrators support for this type of curriculum change in the schools.

       " 'The recent improvements in technology and their integration in language learning have played a facilitating role in vocabulary acquisition. Quizlet, an online teacher-/student-friendly tool, is one of the leading applications in vocabulary acquisition. Along with the effectiveness of visualization in acquiring vocabulary, humor has been also extensively indicated to carry a significant role in language learning. With all its facilitating features, the integration of technology, humor, and vocabulary can be achieved via Quizlet. In this study, the visual integration of humor accompanying vocabulary on Quizlet was taken into scrutiny to see to what extent humor-integrated pictures on Quizlet account for the retention of vocabulary acquisition. With this purpose, this study examined the effect of humor-integrated pictures on vocabulary acquisition of 45 intermediate English as a foreign language (EFL) learners on Quizlet. In so doing, the experimental group received a series of unknown vocabulary items for which the integrated pictures were humorous, while the vocabulary items assigned for the control group were identical, but in non-humorous contexts. At the end, an independent samples t-test applied on the scores achieved from a posttest indicated a significant difference in scores of the control group and that of the experimental group. In fact, the learners in the experimental group significantly outperformed their counterparts in the control group. The results indicated that linking vocabulary items with humorous pictures is more effective than using non-humorous context in learning vocabulary.

Seven two-day workshops were held. In addition to providing inservice training, these workshops collected and experimented with materials for the computer-assisted (CAI) bilingual education teacher training program. A two-week summer workshop was also held for about 20 participants, for two purposes: (1) to review and assist with the development of the CAI program, and (2) to participate in seminars and independent study in bilingual education. During the workshops, changes were observed in teacher  behavior, attitudes, classroom procedures, and curriculum. The CAI bilingual education teacher training program was designed for preservice and inservice teachers and for administrators and other teachers working with bilingual communities.

       " \"Data-Driven Learning (DDL) is a method for learning languages that involves analyzing language usage trends and finding patterns in language data, utilizing technology and statistics. One of the key benefits of DDL is that it allows students to focus on the most relevant and useful language data for their needs. Data-driven learning is an effective approach to language learning that can help students develop their language skills more quickly and efficiently by using data and technology to guide their learning. This case study aims to see if DDL has a positive effect on students' language achievement, digital literacy, and learning motivation. The study has enrolled 28 preparatory class students from a state university and seven native English speakers, comprising four Australians, one American, one Canadian, and one English individual. The native speakers are asked to verbally describe five images and respond to three pertinent questions. The audio recordings of their responses are transcribed by the students, and the data is then entered into AntConc, a corpus analysis toolkit. The students are able to investigate authentic English speech and recognize unknown linguistic structures. The study will clarify its findings and outcomes using quotations from the transcribed speech as well as the students' responses to the DDL activities. The findings imply that DDL is an effective method for teachers who are willing to experiment with alternative ways of teaching a language. It appears that using Data-Driven Learning (DDL) as a teaching strategy has produced largely positive results. Students seem to have responded favorably to the approach, and it has succeeded in increasing their awareness of language and how to study it. Additionally, it appears that DDL has improved learning circumstances over time for all students, particularly those who generally aren't motivated or engaged during traditional classes. The use of technology in the classroom has promoted group projects and boosted involvement from all students, including those with learning challenges.\",\n",

The study group consists of 30 teacher candidates who studied foreign language teaching at various universities in Kazakhstan during the 2020-2021 academic year and 35 English teachers who teach English in secondary schools in Almaty. The study was carried out within the scope of qualitative research and research data were collected with two semi-structured interview forms created by the researcher. The data obtained from the research are categorised by content analysis. As a result of the study, teacher candidates found distance education more inefficient in education than formal education and inadequate to provide distance education. Teachers, on the other hand, saw distance education as advantageous in terms of saving time and space, disadvantaged by student motivation, teacher inexperience and technical glitches. As a result of the research, it has emerged that urgent solutions are needed to eliminate the need to provide a separate education on distance education to teacher candidates and teachers, student motivation and technical problems.',\n",

To compromise, it has become necessary to apply technology in English classes in the 21st century, through which students can access high-quality materials provided globally. Teachers need to tackle new challenges where the trends of technology and gamification in English language learning seem more appealing. This study explores how gamification contributes to student performance and perceptions through the &quot;Winner English&quot; program. The program was designed primarily to be self-paced but has been adapted to be used as a part of compulsory classes at school. The experiment group comprised Grade 9 students from eight Thai secondary schools, while the controlled group from the other eight schools studied English classes traditionally. The posttest results indicate a vast improvement to English performance by the experiment group once the program was integrated into English classes. Individual feedback underlined how the program was supported through gamification, such as the reward system and leaderboards, and offered an excellent opportunity to practice English accurately. Gamification shows promising attributes for English learners whose learning behaviors have become ubiquitous, fun-loving, and autonomous. Understanding the benefits of gamification could spark cautious optimism in English education in Thailand. [The month range (Jan-Jun) on the .pdf is incorrect. The correct range is Jul-Dec.]',\n",

This qualitative study has been carried out by phenomenological research design. The sample group of this study consists of 10 students studying at formal high schools. They were determined using criterion sampling technique. Data was collected by a semi-structured interview method. The data collected was analysed by a descriptive analysis technique. Students have expressed that, according to them, distance education means education using technology, education resulting from the pandemic and inefficient, insufficient education and waste of time for students. Furthermore, students have expressed that they think web2 tools are useful, EIN is insufficient technical installation and resources, and the English course is more fun and attention-grabbing via web2 tools in learning English. Students have listed the following recommendations for obtaining necessary skills in the English language during the distance education period: Writing and translation homework should be assigned to students and students should be provided with more writing exercises for writing skills, students should be provided with more reading comprehension texts and exercises for reading skill, technological obstacles should be removed for speaking skill, teachers should ask random questions to random students so that students get a chance to speak to obtain the speaking skill and more listening exercises should be presented to the students. Lastly, the students have made suggestions like Web2 tools should be used, a number of videos, visual materials and resources should be increased, internet infrastructure should be improved, teachers should give the floor to the students more frequently, E-twinning projects should be run, students should focus on the course, the number of English courses should be increased, students should be motivated by their teachers to increase the effectiveness of English course in the distance education period. In line with the findings, the researchers have concluded that learning English during distance education may become more effective via web2 tools and connection problems should be removed.

       " \"Access to tertiary education is a challenge for many people from refugee-backgrounds. In Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ), resettled refugees are entitled to access education alongside other New Zealanders, and NZ's resettlement policy material recognises education as a key pillar of resettlement. However, refugee-background students are not recognised as 'priority learners' in education policy, so educational institutions are not required to report on refugee-background students' educational access or outcomes. At all levels of the education system, teaching and support practices for refugee-background students vary widely. Many barriers hamper refugee-background students' access to and success in tertiary education. However, refugee-background students are also necessarily-skilful border navigators. In this paper, we share data from an in-progress participatory action research project based in southern NZ that involves collaborating with refugee-background students at the secondary-tertiary education border. After describing the project, its rationale, and our theoretical framework, we draw on insights from seven of the students to illustrate how students represented educational navigation in NZ: as a resistance project, a subterranean project, and a relational project. We conclude by suggesting some implications from our study for research, policy and practice in education.\",\n",
       " \"The Bilingual Education Act of 1968 (also know as Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965) recognized that the educational needs of Limited English Proficient (LEP) students could not be met by traditional, English-only instruction. This legislation provided funding to state education agencies and local school districts to encourage development and implementation of bilingual education programs and has undergone revision in 1974, 1978, 1984, and is part of the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments of 1988 (PL 100-297). The purpose of this paper is to increase school social workers' knowledge about bilingual education and to generate ideas about how they can promote bilingual education for LEP students. Growing evidence in longitudinal studies supports the claim that  early positive school learning experiences result in lower retention and dropout rates. Making use of the LEP students' home languages in initial contacts with school will increase their chances of having positive learning experiences. Success in school will enable LEP students to break the cycle of poverty and ease their entry into mainstream America. The paper presents: (1) an overview of the Hawkins-Stafford Amendments; (2) a case for bilingual education for Hispanic LEP children; (3) pro and con positions on bilingual education; (4) a synthesis of recent research findings; and (5) the role of school social workers in bilingual education. A list of 27 references is included. (ALL)\",\n",
       " \"In the face of sudden migration to online teaching due to Covid-19 pandemic, education is going under trying times globally, especially in the low resource contexts of the Global South. Little is, however, known about how this forced migration to and coping with emergency remote teaching (ERT) are happening in the low resource context of developing Bangladesh, particularly in the Higher Education (HE). This paper, therefore, aims to understand how virtual classrooms look like in the Higher Education context in Bangladesh through TESOL teachers' narratives from initial virtual classrooms imparting ERT. Employing narrative inquiry, four teachers from four different public and private universities in Bangladesh share their experiences of doing, undergoing and reflecting as they try to adopt, adapt and strive in imparting ERT and carrying out education in HE. Insights from these initial teacher narratives may inform higher education pedagogies, teacher development in distance education environments in Bangladesh and similar contexts in the Global South. As the paper addresses HE teachers' initial orientation to ERT without exclusively dealing with TESOL education, it has multidisciplinary approach to migration to and coping with ERT in HE in general.\",\n",
       " \"Technology integration has become increasingly prevalent in language education and technology teaching tools are currently used for English instruction. In line with this trend, it is also believed to be influential in teaching and learning pronunciation. To cast an empirical light on this issue, this study aimed to analyse the influence of Virtual Reality Assisted Pronunciation Training (VRAPT) on pronunciation of young Iranian EFL learners. With respect to this, 18 low-intermediate English language learners (6-12 years old) were invited to take part in the study held in the lab at Sharif University of Technology in Iran. First, their English language pronunciation was measured by a pronunciation pre-test through &quot;Speech ace Browser.&quot; Next, in a virtual environment, during 10 sessions (each session 90 minutes), the participants received instructions on all of the pronunciation items measured in the test (consists of English vowels like /[near-close near-front unrounded vowel]/ and /i/ and also vowels of /[near-close back rounded vowel]/ and /u/) through the Virtual Reality (VR) game administered by a humanoid robot. The results of a paired samples t-test revealed that there was a significant difference between learners' performance before and after the training sessions. This paper recommends that simulated games within virtual reality could be applied in enhancing pronunciation skills of EFL learners and utilized in helping them to develop native-like pronunciation. It also generates new ways of thinking about VRAPT as an innovative teaching approach and creating an efficient and pleasurable English learning environment.\",\n",
